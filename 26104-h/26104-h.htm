<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Brother and Sister.</span></h2>


<p><span class="sp1">'I</span> say, we've got a new boy at Torrington's.
Haven't had one for ages and ages, so
it's made quite a stir among us.'</p>

<p>'You can make stir enough when you are
coming out of school,' said his sister, lifting
her eyes from her lessons and looking across
the table.</p>

<p>'Who is the new boy?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Nobody knows&mdash;that's the fun,' said
Leonard, with a short whistle.</p>

<p>'Don't you even know his name?'</p>

<p>'That's just like a girl, Duffy; you're worse
than usual,' said her brother, setting his elbows
on the table, and nibbling the end of the pen-holder
in a meditative fashion. 'Of course he
was properly introduced to the class as Mr.
Horace Howard.'</p>

<p>'Howard is a nice name,' commented
Duffy, whose real name was Florence. 'It
was Aunt Lucy's name before she was
married, you know.'</p>

<p>No, I don't know.  I may have heard it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
but the name's nothing. I don't suppose his
father was hanged!' said her brother.</p>

<p>'Perhaps he is some distant relative of the
Duke of Norfolk? though auntie says she
has nothing to do with those Howards.'</p>

<p>A mocking laugh greeted this suggestion.
'Go on, Duffy, let us have some more of your
wisdom.'</p>

<p>'I don't see what there is to laugh at, Len,
and I am sure I don't want to hear about the
new boy,' said his sister indignantly, and she
turned to her lessons once more.</p>

<p>This brought a fusillade of paper pellets
from the student sitting opposite. She bore
it patiently for a minute or two, and then
angrily demanded why he did not get on with
his lessons and let her do the same, and
threatened to ring the bell.</p>

<p>'Don't be a bigger duffer than you are, Flo.
You can't help being a girl, I know; but I'm
willing to help you all I can out of a girl's
foolishness. Only a girl would talk of ringing
the bell, and making a row, because she can't
have all her own way. Come now, I want to
talk to you about the new boy, and we can
finish the lesson afterwards.'</p>

<p>'But you say you don't know anything
about him, and so there's nothing to talk
about,' said his sister.</p>

<p>'Yes, that's just it. Why shouldn't the
fellow tell us who his people are, where he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
comes from, and what he's going to do with
himself by-and-by?'</p>

<p>It was his sister's turn to laugh now.
'What queer notions boys have!' she exclaimed.
'I suppose you expect a new
scholar to come and say, "My father is a
doctor, or a lawyer, and we have three
servants at our house," as soon as the master
has introduced him to the class.'</p>

<p>A ball of paper was levelled at Duffy's
head for this remark. 'Who said he was to
do it the first day or the second day? But
when a fellow has been there nearly a fortnight
you expect to hear something about who he is.'</p>

<p>'But suppose he don't choose to tell you,
what then?'</p>

<p>'Yes, that's it. How are we going to
make him? What would you do, Duffy?
That's what I want to know.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I'm only a girl,' said Duffy with a
laugh. 'I can't be expected to understand
boys' affairs like that.'</p>

<p>'Yes, you do&mdash;that's just what girls do
understand. We can't have a good stand up
fight, which is the way we generally settle
things.'</p>

<p>'Why not? If the new boy won't do as
the rest tell him, then fight it out, if he won't
give in!'</p>

<p>Leonard heaved a sigh of despair. 'There
never was anything half so stupid as a girl!'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
he exclaimed. 'Do you think if it was anything
we could settle off-hand like that I
should ask you about it?'</p>

<p>'Well, tell me what it is, and I'll help you
if I can. What is the new boy like?' she
asked.</p>

<p>'Oh, like most other fellows, I suppose, or
at least he was the first day, I know, for I took
particular notice as he came into the class; but
the last day or two he has come in a jacket
that ought to have gone to the rag-bag three
months ago, and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'But his jacket can't hurt you,' interrupted
his sister, 'you don't have to wear it.'</p>

<p>'You stupid duffer! don't he go to Torrington's,
I tell you, and haven't we got to
stand up for the honour of the school?'</p>

<p>'Who&mdash;the boys or the head master?'
asked Duffy innocently.</p>

<p>'Why, all of us, to be sure, and we mean to
do it too. Why, Torrington's is as good
as Eton.'</p>

<p>'Oh yes, of course it's a good school,'
admitted Duffy.</p>

<p>'Yes, and we mean to keep it so; we don't
mean to have any cads among us.'</p>

<p>'Is the new boy a cad, then?' asked his
sister.</p>

<p>'He can't be anything else, if the story Bob
Taylor has heard is true. He brought it to
school yesterday, and says he knows it is a fact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
That the new fellow is a scholarship boy from
one of those low board schools in Middleton,
and that he walks back to the town every
day.'</p>

<p>'What is a scholarship boy?' asked Duffy.</p>

<p>'Why, a poor beggar who can't afford to
pay his own schooling, and so the County
Council pay it for him.'</p>

<p>'What a shame!' exclaimed the young
lady indignantly. 'Mamma was saying only
yesterday how much our schooling cost. Why
don't the County Council pay for us, especially
as father has something to do with it?'</p>

<p>Leonard shook his head. He either did
not know or did not choose to tell his sister the
conditions upon which County Scholarships
were granted. He merely remarked, 'You're
a dreadful duffer about some things, Flo. But
you could tell us what girls would do if their
school was going to be dragged down.'</p>

<p>But Florence shook her head. 'I don't
know what we should do,' she said, 'because I
am not one of the elder girls, and we juniors
don't count for much; but if the girl weren't
nice I should not speak to her or help her with
her lessons or anything.'</p>

<p>'Oh, the beggar don't want any help
with <i>his</i> lessons. He has climbed to the
top of the class, and hooked Taylor out of
his place already. And old Mason actually
had the cheek to tell us to-day that we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
should have to pay a good deal more attention
to our home work, or else Howard would
carry off all the prizes by-and-by. I should
like to see him do it,' he added.</p>

<p>'No, you wouldn't; and so you had better
get on with your lessons now,' said the young
lady practically.</p>

<p>'No, no! let's settle this first. You
haven't told me what a girl's way would be
with a fellow like this Howard.'</p>

<p>'Why, if he isn't nice, don't speak to him.
Of course you can't help it if he does his
lessons better than you do, or you must work
at them a little more carefully, I suppose, if
you mean to get ahead of him in the class
and take some of the prizes!'</p>

<p>'Oh, prizes be bothered!' exclaimed
Leonard crossly, for his sister's advice had
not pleased him at all. 'I tell you we want
to get rid of the fellow if we can. Taylor
says the head master ought to have refused
to take a scholarship boy.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps father could interfere,' said
Florence. 'He has a good deal to do with
the Council.'</p>

<p>'If you breathe a word of what I've said
to father, I'll never speak to you again!' said
her brother vehemently. 'The idea of such
a thing! Tell father, indeed! What would
the other fellows say, do you think? No, no,
we can fight our own battle, and defend the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
honour of the school in our own way. A
nice hash you would make of everything.
You are a worse duffer than I thought,
though I don't think you are a tell-tale.'</p>

<p>'Of course I shall not tell father what
we have been talking about, if that is what
you mean,' said Duffy, a little indignantly.
The tears were shining in her eyes, for she
was very fond of her brother, and always
ready to help him whenever she was allowed,
and so she felt this scornful rebuff the more
keenly.</p>

<p>'There, you needn't cry over it. I
suppose you can't help being only a girl.
But mind, if you say a word to father or
mother of what I have told you, I never will
speak to you again!' And with this last
threat Leonard turned with a sigh to his
lessons.</p>

<p>'I've wasted a lot of time over you this
evening,' he said, after a short silence, during
which Duffy had been muttering over a
French verb. 'I'm awfully disappointed
about it,' he went on, 'for I shall have to
tell Taylor and the rest that you're nothing
but a duffer.'</p>

<p>'Because I can't tell you how to manage
with a boy that I don't know; it isn't fair,
Len, and you say boys always are fair,' said
his sister, in a tone of protest, as she turned
to her lessons once more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Leonard tried to follow her example, but
he could not fix his attention upon problems
in Euclid with that greater problem unsolved&mdash;how
the honour of the school was to be
saved, and the new boy got rid of? That
was really what Taylor and one or two leading
spirits had decided must be done; but
how to do it was the puzzle!</p>

<p>Leonard's lessons were very imperfectly
prepared that night, and every moment he
could snatch the next morning was given to
looking over his books, that he might not
utterly fail when he was called upon to produce
what he should have learned; and he was conning
over one task as he walked to school,
when he was overtaken by Taylor and the
rest.</p>

<p>'Oh, I say, Dabbs'&mdash;Len's nickname
among his friends&mdash;'we saw that new fellow
with another carrying a basket of tools&mdash;looked
like a carpenter's basket,' said one.</p>

<p>'It was his brother, too, I know&mdash;looked as
though he was going wood-chopping somewhere,'
said another. But Taylor slipped his
arm in Len's and drew him aside. 'Look
here, what are we going to do about it&mdash;what
did your clever sister say?'</p>

<p>'She couldn't think of anything last night,
she was too busy.'</p>

<p>'Oh, that's all rot you know. You said she
would be sure to think of something clever,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and it's come to this&mdash;that we must do something
at once, or Torrington's will go to the
dogs, with working fellows coming here and
lording it over gentlemen. The question is
how are we to get rid of him?'</p>

<p>'Yes, that's it. How are we? It is easy
to say, get rid of him, but the question is&mdash;how?
The only thing that we can do at
present that I can see is to send him to
Coventry!'</p>

<p>To send a boy to Coventry required united
action on the part of the whole school, but
Leonard Morrison and Taylor, with one or
two of their friends, did not despair of persuading
their class-mates to follow their example.
Of course the boys in the lower classes might
speak an occasional word, and the seniors in
the upper form might have occasion to do the
same, but the classes in this school were large
and practically self-contained, so that they had
little to do with those in the upper or junior
classes; it was therefore comparatively easy for
the leading spirits to persuade or compel the
rest to follow their lead, whatever it might be.</p>

<p>So the day following the talk between the
brother and sister, Horace Howard found
himself sent to Coventry, as his foes had
decreed. As he was a quiet, studious lad, he
did not notice this at first, but by degrees it
impressed itself upon him that no one had
asked him a question all day, or even told him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
that he must not do this or that. He felt
vaguely uncomfortable before he set off on his
long walk home; and when he found that
several of his schoolfellows, who had previously
talked to him as they walked part of the way
together, ran off as soon as the gate was
passed, his heart sank within him, and he
wondered what he could have done to bring
this punishment upon himself.</p>

<p>But, whatever he might feel, he determined
not to let his mother know anything about it,
and so he went into the little room where she
sat at work, whistling cheerily as usual.</p>

<p>'Stitch, stitch, stitch,' he said, as his
mother looked up from her work for the
accustomed kiss.</p>

<p>'You're earlier to-night, dear,' said Mrs.
Howard, as she laid aside her work and drew
the tea-tray close to her.</p>

<p>'I suppose I walked a bit faster, and
didn't gossip quite so much,' said the lad,
and he had to strangle a sigh as he spoke,
lest his mother should detect it.</p>

<p>'Are you hungry, my boy?' said his
mother as he hung up his cap.</p>

<p>'Not very,' answered Horace, for he
knew by this time that it was inconvenient
for him to have a large appetite, and so he
was learning to regulate it by the state of
their finances.</p>

<p>'You went in your old jacket again to-day,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Horace,' she remarked as she set his dinner
before him, for he took his mid-day meal with
him to school.</p>

<p>'Yes, I wore my old jacket. Why not?'
said Horace. 'You mended it up so nicely
that it was a pity not to give it another turn
and save the other. Jackets can't be picked
up in the street, you know; and though we
may sometimes pick wool off the hedges, it
isn't woven and made up into boys' jackets.'</p>

<p>Horace talked on in this strain, to prevent
his mother from asking questions as to how
he had got on at school during the day, for
Mrs. Howard knew something of the ways of
boys, and was terribly afraid lest some of her
son's schoolfellows should find out something
of their circumstances, and not treat Horace
as they would an equal.</p>

<p>Nothing but the lad's love of science and
her desire to give him an education that would
fit him to make use of this talent, had made
her willing to consent that he should compete
for a scholarship that would enable him to do
this. It was the first time, she knew, that a
boy from the board school had ever been
admitted to this exclusive grammar school
known as 'Torrington's'; and she had
watched anxiously each day, to find out
whether the lads were treating their poorer
companion kindly and courteously, and thus
far she had been perfectly satisfied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Her elder son was as anxious as she was
that Horace should have all the advantages
a good education could give, but he was
opposed to his brother going to Torrington's.</p>

<p>'I am only a carpenter,' he said, 'and
never want to be anything better, but it
won't suit those boys to hear that one of
their schoolfellows has a brother who is a
common working man.'</p>

<p>'You are not a common working man,
Fred,' said his mother quickly.</p>

<p>'Not to you, perhaps, mother mine, but I
want you to look at things as the world
does. I do common work&mdash;carpenter's work,
and am glad to get the chance of doing it,
and to help you and Horace. Here we can
only be common working people&mdash;you sewing
for the shops and I working for a builder.
That is all the people know, and all we want
them to know, and I wish Horace could
have been a carpenter too.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps it would have been as well,'
said his mother with a sigh.</p>

<p>'I am sure it would. We agreed to come
here and leave the whole miserable past
behind.'</p>

<p>'It is left behind,' interrupted his mother
quickly.</p>

<p>'Ah, yes, we have done our best; but who
knows what questions may be asked, now
Horace has gone to that school? Boys are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
often curious in their inquiries, and it is not
as though&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Fred, Fred, we must leave these things
in the hand of God, and be content to take
one step at a time. I could not, in fairness
to Horace, let him throw away this opportunity
of getting a good education that will fit him
to use the gifts which I believe God has
given him.'</p>

<p>This conversation had taken place at
dinner-time that very day, and Mrs. Howard
was thinking of it as she watched Horace eat
his dinner.</p>

<p>The boy knew that his mother's eyes were
upon him, and he was the more anxious to
guard his secret, and so he rattled on until
his mother forgot her fears, and thought Fred
was making himself anxious without the
slightest shadow of cause.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Sending Him to Coventry</span>.</h2>


<p><span class="sp1">H</span>orace Howard sat longer over
his lessons that night, and was quite
undisturbed by any talking with his
mother and brother, and when the time came
for him to put the lessons aside and go to
bed, he knew he had only half mastered them,
for his thoughts had wandered continually from
the subject of the lesson before him to the
events of his day at school, trying to discover
what he had done to offend his schoolfellows,
that they should all at once send him to
Coventry in this fashion. The study of
mathematics, French, chemistry, and physics
did not help him to the solution of this
problem; but the school mystery greatly
hindered the other subjects from becoming
clear to his mind, and when he took his place
in class the next morning he knew it would
be a bad day for him with his class-work.</p>

<p>It was worse even than he feared, and as
he lost place after place, and went down at
last even below the dunces of the form, it
hurt him more to see how gleeful the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
boys were over his mistakes than to lose his
place in the class.</p>

<p>At last, when Horace had blundered worse
than usual over some lesson, the master said,
'What is the matter with you to-day, Howard?
Are you ill? Have you got a headache?'</p>

<p>'No, sir,' answered Horace, for he was
a truthful lad, and could not avail himself of
the excuse the master had thus offered him.</p>

<p>'You could not have prepared your lessons
last night, then; you know the rule about
this, don't you?' said the master sternly.</p>

<p>'Yes, sir; I studied my lessons for more than
two hours last night,' said Horace, reddening
and growing more confused, for he knew all
the class were staring at him, and, as he
fancied, glorying in his discomfiture. In this
he was not far wrong; but there were one or
two who pitied him in his various dilemmas,
and would have broken that ban of silence that
had been decreed against him, but the leaders
kept their eyes upon them, and they would not
venture to brave the displeasure of their
elders.</p>

<p>Altogether it was a cruelly hard day for
Horace, and he felt strongly inclined to say
when he went home, that he would never go
near the school again, but become a carpenter
like his brother. One trade would be as good
as another, if he could not go on and learn
more of the mysteries of chemistry and physics<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
It was some consolation to him that his master
had told him to prepare a special lesson in
chemistry, in readiness for some practical
experiments that were to take place the following
day.</p>

<p>In his eagerness over this Horace forgot
the vexations and trials of the day, and had
mastered it so quickly, that he was able to look
over again the lessons that had floored him in
class. These imperfect lessons would be like
the damaged links of a chain, and might bring
him trouble again and again, if he did not
repair the mischief at once; and so by the time
he went to bed he had well-nigh mastered all
the difficulties, and worked himself into a state
of self-content, which was about the best
preparation for the next day's work, for he
went to sleep without a thought beyond his
lessons, and took his place in the class looking
bright and cheery once more.</p>

<p>To-day was to be a sort of recapitulation of
the previous fortnight's work in chemistry, and
the stupid blunders made the previous day
were more than atoned for, and at last when
the boy had worked out a brilliant result that
greatly surprised the master he said, 'Why,
you must have been ill yesterday.'</p>

<p>'No, sir, I was well,' said Horace, seeing
the master waited for an answer. 'I was well
enough, but I was not quite happy.'</p>

<p>'Well, then, let me advise you to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
yourself happy in future under any circumstances.'
And then he added in an undertone,
'You are a scholarship lad, and we expect more
from you than from some of the others.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, sir, I'll try,' said Horace; and
throughout that day he did not find it hard to
try, as the master had suggested.</p>

<p>The others had their eyes upon him, and
were puzzled to account for his success. They
had made up their minds the previous day that
they would only have to carry on their present
tactics for a short time, and Horace would
leave the school in disgust, or else he would be
asked to leave by the head master, and thus
Torrington's would be saved from going to the
dogs through this scholarship boy. But this
day's experience of what Horace could do
under the terrible ban of their displeasure
puzzled them, and they resolved to watch more
closely, to make sure none of those who were
suspected of faltering in allegiance to the
decree of their leaders did not speak to him
on their way home.</p>

<p>But Horace himself did not expect this
now. The first bitterness of the trial had
worn off, and as soon as he was beyond the
school gate he set off home at a sharp trot,
softly whistling to himself, as he pondered
over what would be the probable effect if a
certain acid they had been using was mixed
with another substance entirely different from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
anything  they had used in that day's
experiments.</p>

<p>He whistled and thought, and turned the
matter over and over in his mind, and finally
ended by wishing that his mother could afford
to give him pocket-money like most boys had
to spend. This cost him a sigh, as he thought
he might as well wish for a slice of the moon
at once as for pocket-money, and by the time
he got home he was whistling to himself again
as happily as ever.</p>

<p>When he got in, his mother noticed his
eager, animated looks.</p>

<p>'Why, what has happened to make you
so merry?' she said, as he threw up his cap
in sheer exuberance of spirits.</p>

<p>'Nothing much, mother; only I have got
an idea.'</p>

<p>'Keep it, then, lad&mdash;keep it,' said his
brother, laughing.</p>

<p>'All right,' said Horace, thinking he should
be under no temptation to part with it, since
his schoolfellows would not speak to him.
'It's a good idea, I know, if I can only find
out the way to carry it out,' added Horace,
at which his brother laughed, and his mother
remarked that a good many people had
ideas, but the difficulty was to carry them
into effect, so that they were of practical
use.</p>

<p>'Oh, it will want a good deal of thinking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
about, I know; but it has made me quite
decide not to be a carpenter.'</p>

<p>'I thought you had made up your mind
about that long ago,' said Fred.</p>

<p>'Ah, but I was thinking the other day it
would be a great deal easier to be a
carpenter, and earn money. I wasn't sure
that I ought not to do something to help
mother soon.'</p>

<p>'No, my boy,' interrupted Mrs. Howard;
'it would not be your duty to give up all
opportunity of using the talents God has
given you, when the way has been made
clear for you to receive the education that
will fit you to use them by-and-by. Fred
always liked cutting wood and making boats
and stools, just as you are fond of making
chemical experiments, and watching what the
result will be.'</p>

<p>'I wouldn't be anything but a carpenter;
but I shall study mathematics more, that I
may do better at my trade by-and-by,' said
Fred. 'Every man to his trade, I suppose;
but there's nothing like making things, I
think,' he added.</p>

<p>So the brothers agreed to differ; but it
was a very happy evening to Horace, and
he thought he had overcome all his difficulties,
and could be very happy, in spite of the ban
that his schoolfellows had placed upon him.
He learned his lessons that night without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
difficulty, and the next morning began to
recover his place in the class; but the hour
of recess tried him sorely.</p>

<p>A few of the boys who lived in the
neighbourhood went home to dinner from
one to two o'clock, but many who came from
a distance brought luncheon with them, or
had dinner provided for them at the school.
There was a luncheon room provided for
those who brought their meals with them,
but Horace had preferred eating his slice of
bread and butter or bread and dripping,
walking about the playground. There were
others who did the same thing, but they
walked in groups and chatted and frolicked,
or played games, and when he first came
Horace had been invited to join these, and
had been initiated into the mysteries of one
game peculiar to the school, which was,
therefore, very popular among the boys.</p>

<p>Now, however, this was altered. Horace
was left severely alone, and though a boy
might go shouting round for another to make
up the game, no one ever asked Horace to
take the vacant place. He was left to walk
up and down the side of the playground
until the bell rang for afternoon school, and
then the boys who might be near, as they
were passing in, took care to hold as far
aloof from him as possible.</p>

<p>Horace wondered how long this was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
going to last. He had made several attempts
to break through this silent persecution, but
each boy to whom he had spoken had walked
away as though he was stone deaf; and so
at last Horace gave up the attempt, and
tried to be happy in spite of this.</p>

<p>'I say, Morrison, how much longer is
that beggar going to hold out?' said Taylor,
one day speaking to Leonard, as though he
ought to know all about it.</p>

<p>Taylor had lost his place in the class,
and so had Leonard, and neither felt very
amiable.</p>

<p>'Ask him, if you want to know. I'm
nearly sick of it, I can tell you. It's lasted
a month now, and I think we may as well
give it up.'</p>

<p>'I daresay you do. My brother who has
just come home from Oxford, says it is your
people who have brought him into the
school.'</p>

<p>'My people!' shouted Leonard, crimson
with wrath at the insinuation. 'Who do you
mean by "my people?" and why should you
think so?'</p>

<p>'Now don't get mad, Len,' said Taylor
in a quieter tone. 'But you know your father
is on the County Council, and they say it
was he who recommended that Howard
should be sent to Torrington's.'</p>

<p>'I don't believe it!' blazed Leonard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Morrison; and then with fine inconsistency
he added, 'If he did, it was because the
fellow got a scholarship, and he had to go
somewhere.'</p>

<p>'Anywhere but at Torrington's would
have done for him,' grumbled Taylor; 'and
I think the master or the Council ought to
turn him out, now they know the rest of the
fellows don't like it.'</p>

<p>'But do they know we have sent him to
Coventry?' asked Leonard.</p>

<p>'Are they bats&mdash;do they go about with
their eyes shut&mdash;haven't you noticed that
Howard has been up in the chemistry "lab."
yesterday and to-day all the lunch time? I
saw Skeats speaking to him yesterday just
after we came into the playground, and the
two walked away together. It was the same
again to-day, only Howard was looking out
for him, and went to meet him as soon as
he appeared. Now what are we going to
do, if the masters try to beat us at this
game?'</p>

<p>'I say it isn't fair,' answered Morrison.</p>

<p>'Fair! I call it the meanest thing I ever
heard of, and shows that Torrington's is going
to the dogs, masters and all. I wish you'd
speak to your pater about it, Morrison. I
think you might, now Skeats has taken to interfering
with us like this.'</p>

<p>Leonard shrugged his shoulders. 'I think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
it would be better for somebody else to
come and see my father, if they think he had
anything to do with sending that boy here.
You don't know the pater. He'd just turn
me inside out, and then laugh at me; but
he couldn't serve any other fellow that
way.'</p>

<p>But Taylor shook his head. It was true
that he did not know Dr. Morrison, but he had
heard that this gentleman had said it would
be for the advantage of Torrington's to receive
a few scholarship boys, for they were sure to
be sharp, studious lads, and it would waken
the other boys up and put them on their
mettle. So he declined to go and see Mr.
Morrison, but declared that Leonard ought
to undertake the mission on behalf of the
school.</p>

<p>'Look here, Curtis!' he called to another
lad, who, like himself, was one of the elders of
the class, and consequently domineered a good
deal over the rest. 'Morrison won't do his
duty in upholding the honour of the school.
You come and talk to him.'</p>

<p>'What's the row?' asked Curtis loftily,
sauntering up with his hands in his pockets,
and looking down upon Leonard Morrison
as a big overgrown lad likes to look at
one of his smaller schoolfellows, as if to
intimidate him with his superior height and
bulk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>'Now, then, little Morrison, speak up.
What is it?' he said in a sleepy tone, but
trying to look fierce.</p>

<p>'Why, it's just this, Curtis, that beggar we
have sent to Coventry don't seem inclined to
take himself out of the school, and so somebody
must be made to move him.'</p>

<p>'Of course,' said Curtis, who did not mind
who the somebody might be, so long as he was
not called upon to exert himself beyond a little
bullying, 'you hear, little Morrison, just you do
as you're told!' he commanded.</p>

<p>'This is what I want him to do,' explained
Taylor. 'I have heard that it is all through
his father that we have got the beggar here,
and so it's Mr. Morrison and that precious
Council that must move him.'</p>

<p>'Of course,' assented Curtis. 'You hear,
Morrison?'</p>

<p>'I tell you it must be some of the other
fellows that must go and explain to the pater
that the school don't like scholarship boys.
You don't know my pater,' he went on, a
little plaintively. 'He would very likely
report us to the head master for sending the
fellow to Coventry, and then where should
we be?'</p>

<p>'Where we are now, but that fellow
wouldn't.'</p>

<p>'I tell you, Curtis, you don't know the
pater. He would ask what he had done that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the school had sent him to Coventry, and you
know well enough that we haven't acted on
the square with him.'</p>

<p>'Oh, that's it, is it? You are going to
take his part now, and peach on us!' raved
Taylor.</p>

<p>Curtis yawned. 'You'd better give in,
and do as Taylor orders you.'</p>

<p>'Well, then, I should peach, and no
mistake, if I told my father we had sent the
fellow to Coventry for the last month.
"What for?" he would say in his quiet
way, while he looked into your very soul, so
that you knew you must make a clean
breast of everything. No, thank you. I
don't mind going with you and Taylor and
two or three other fellows as a sort of deputation
from&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Deputation be bothered!' interrupted
Taylor viciously. 'Why should we go cap
in hand to ask your father to take the fellow
away? It ought to be enough for you to tell
him that the school don't like it, and that we
are determined to uphold the honour of
Torrington's.'</p>

<p>'Yes, that's it. We don't mean to let
the school go to the dogs to please anybody,'
said Curtis lazily.</p>

<p>'Yes; and what are we to do next, for
the beggar don't seem to care now whether
we send him to Coventry or not, and Skeats<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
is giving the game away by letting him
go to the chemistry "lab." every dinner
hour.'</p>

<p>'Let's send Skeats to Coventry,' said
Curtis.</p>

<p>Leonard laughed at the suggestion, but
Taylor grew more angry.</p>

<p>'It's no good fooling over this now,' he
said. 'I have been talking to some of the
fellows in the sixth, and they have made up
their minds not to have the beggar among
them.'</p>

<p>'All right, let them get rid of him,
then,' said Curtis. 'I don't see why we
should do their dirty work. When's he going
up?'</p>

<p>'He swats as though he expected to go
next term,' complained Leonard Morrison,
who had lost his place in the class that
morning through Horace.</p>

<p>'Swats! It's shameful the pace that
fellow goes with his lessons; and the masters
think we ought to do the same,' foamed
Taylor.</p>

<p>'Ah, they've tried to force it upon all of
us,' observed Curtis; 'but I won't let it
disturb me, I can tell you.'</p>

<p>'You don't mind being the dunce of
the school,' said Leonard, with a short
laugh.</p>

<p>'I don't care what the fellows call me, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
long as they let me alone,' said the young
giant, still with his hands in his pockets.
He was getting tired of the discussion, and
Taylor saw that it was of little use trying
to threaten Leonard, and so he walked
sulkily away, to try and think out some other
means of getting rid of the obnoxious
scholarship boy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Cock of the Walk</span>.</h2>


<p><span class="sp1">'I</span> say, Duffy, there's an awful row among
the fellows at school; Taylor and Curtis
are like raging bulls over this new fellow,
and they say it's all the pater's fault.'</p>

<p>The brother and sister were sitting at their
lessons in the little room known as the study,
as they sat when this story opened. Several
weeks, however, had elapsed since that time,
and Florence, having her own cares and interests
to think of, had well-nigh forgotten how she had
been appealed to in the matter of the new boy.</p>

<p>'What are you talking about, Len?' she
asked, after a pause, during which she had
been muttering over a French verb, with her
hand covering the page, by way of testing
whether she knew her lesson.</p>

<p>'That's like a girl!' answered her brother
tartly. 'I have told you more than once
or twice about that new boy at Torrington's,
and now you ask me what I am talking
about.'</p>

<p>'Oh, well, I didn't know he was so in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>teresting
as all that. You told me a week
or two ago that you had sent him to Coventry
and settled him, and so of course I thought it
was all over,' said the young lady, propping
her chin in her hands and looking across at her
brother.</p>

<p>'But if a fellow won't be settled, what are
you to do? I want you to tell me that, Duffy.'</p>

<p>The young lady shook her head. 'Tell us
all about it, Len, I'm not very busy to-night.'</p>

<p>'Well, we sent that fellow to Coventry, as
I told you&mdash;not that he's a bad sort of chap;
only he came from one of those beastly board
schools in the town, and we didn't know who
he was or what he was, and he kept his mouth
shut about his people, and so the fellows took
up the notion that Torrington's would soon go
to the dogs if we let that sort of cattle stay
there, and so we said he must go. Well, we
thought the Coventry game had done the trick
for us just at first, for you never saw such an
awful ass as he made of himself one morning
at all the classes. "Howard, are you ill?"
said Skeats at last, in his sharp way. And we
thought the beggar would get off for the rest
of the lessons. But, if you'll believe it, he was
game enough to say, "No, sir, I'm quite well,"
which was as good as telling Skeats he was a
fool for asking such a question.'</p>

<p>Florence nodded. 'I like plucky boys,'
she said approvingly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>'Well, it was a plucky thing to do, I daresay,
but it didn't help him much with Skeats
that day, for he never spared him a bit, as he
did not take the excuse that had been offered
him, and he blundered and floundered worse
than ever, so that Curtis, the biggest dunce in
the class, answered for him, and took his place
in the class.'</p>

<p>'What a shame!' said Florence, pityingly.</p>

<p>'Well, I felt sorry for the poor little beggar
at last, for we knew he had swatted well over
the lesson, and yet he seemed to have lost
his wits. "That's done the trick," Taylor
whispered to me, when Skeats frowned at him
once for being such an ass. "We shan't see
that scholarship swatter here any more."'</p>

<p>'Swatter,' repeated Florence. 'But I
thought you said he didn't know his lessons.'</p>

<p>'Ah! that once. But it wasn't for the
want of swatting, for it was just that that
put the fellows' backs up. He comes into
the school looking as meek as a rabbit. "I've
been to the board school," he says to Taylor,
when he put him through the usual mill. Not
a word did he say about French and Latin,
and so Taylor thought he would have him
for a fag, as he was a junior; but we soon
found out that we should have to swat over
our lessons, and no mistake, if we were to
keep out of rows with the masters. He set
the pace, don't you see, till Taylor got as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
mad as a hatter when he lost his place at
the top of the class, and then he said this
new boy would have to go.'</p>

<p>'Because he learned his lessons better
than the rest!' exclaimed his sister.</p>

<p>'Well, not that exactly&mdash;of course not,'
replied her brother; 'but you see he was
only a board school boy, and his mother
couldn't be a lady, and his brother is only a
common carpenter, they say; and so for a
fellow like that to come to Torrington's would
just ruin the school. That's why we want
to get rid of him, don't you see?'</p>

<p>'No, I don't,' said Florence, indignantly;
'and Taylor and the rest are a set of mean
cads!' The expression was not very elegant
or ladylike; but she had learned it from her
brother, and knew he would feel the reproach
conveyed by this word more surely than by
anything else she could say.</p>

<p>It stung him into a fierce passion of wrath.
'What do girls know about boys' schools
and boys' ways?' he demanded.</p>

<p>'I know what you have told me about
Taylor and the rest, and I say they are not
gentlemen, but a set of mean cads.' She was
careful not to include Leonard in this scathing
denunciation, for she added, 'I should not
like to think my brother would act like that.'</p>

<p>'Oh, well, Duffy, you see you are a girl,
and can't be expected to know everything;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
but I did tell Taylor to-day that I thought
we might leave the beggar alone, and let him
out of Coventry now.'</p>

<p>'If I was the new boy, I would send you
there, and see how you liked it. What are
you going to do?' she asked.</p>

<p>'That's just it&mdash;just what I wanted to
talk to you about. The fellows say it is all
the pater's doings that Howard has been sent
to Torrington's, and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Florence clapped her hands. 'Dear old
daddy!' she said. 'He knew what Torrington's
wanted. Now go on,' she added.</p>

<p>'It's no good when you interrupt like
that. I wanted to tell you what the fellows
are saying; and now if I do, you'll just go
and peach about the whole thing.'</p>

<p>'Now, Len, did I ever peach about anything
you told me? Haven't we always been
fair and square to each other?' expostulated
his sister, who felt herself insulted by such
a charge.</p>

<p>'Yes, you always have been pretty fair for
a girl,' admitted her brother, 'and I hope you'll
remember that mum must be the word still.
And mind, if you hear about this, you don't
know anything, but just tell the pater to ask
me about it. I don't want you to go and give
your opinion about the school and the fellows,
though Curtis and one or two more may be a
poor lot. The thing is, they feel themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
insulted by having this scholarship boy sent to
Torrington's, and they want me to speak to
the pater about it.'</p>

<p>'Oh, do&mdash;do, and let me be there when you
tell him,' said Florence, her eyes dancing with
glee at the prospect.</p>

<p>'Don't be a duffer. Do you think I don't
know my own daddy well enough to know
that it would be no good going to him with
the fellows' complaints? I told Taylor he
had better come and see the pater himself
about it.'</p>

<p>'Of course,' nodded Florence, 'that would
be the proper way, and I should like to see
them do it.' And again the girl laughed.</p>

<p>This seemed to annoy her brother. 'It's
all very well for you to laugh,' he said. 'You
don't know what it is to be mixed up with
such an affair, and I want to know what I am
to do.'</p>

<p>'What do they want you to do?'</p>

<p>'Haven't I told you? They say I must
get the pater to remove Howard from the
school at once. And one of the fellows told
me as I came home that he overheard Taylor
and Curtis say that, if it wasn't pretty soon
done, they'd send me to Coventry, and find out
some other way to get rid of Howard.'</p>

<p>'I wouldn't care if I was you.'</p>

<p>'Wouldn't you? If you was a boy, you'd
know what it was to be sent to Coventry,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
perhaps, and let me tell you, you wouldn't
want a second dose. It's none so pleasant, I
can tell you, to have this fellow turn his
back, and begin to whistle if you attempt to
speak to him. Why, they make it so strict at
Torrington's that if the master sends a message
to a fellow in Coventry, they fetch a junior to
deliver it. Oh, I know enough to make me
hate the thought of it, and so would you.'</p>

<p>'Girls are not so nasty as that,' said
Florence, 'but I tell you what you could do if
they send you to Coventry&mdash;chum up with
the new boy. I should think he was a nice
fellow.'</p>

<p>But Leonard turned up his nose at the
suggestion. 'He isn't much at games,' he
said. 'I don't think he ever saw a fives court
until he came to Torrington's; and I do like a
good game at fives.'</p>

<p>'I'd play by myself then,' said his sister.</p>

<p>'Ah! and see every other fellow pick up
his ball and walk out of the court as soon as
you appeared. You'd feel like playing then,
wouldn't you?' he added.</p>

<p>His sister sighed. She was very fond of
Leonard, although he was not very brave, she
feared. Still, big lads like Taylor and Curtis
could make things very uncomfortable for the
younger and weaker lads, like Leonard.</p>

<p>'Now just see if you can't help me out of
this hole, Flo,' said the boy, after another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
pause. 'I told the fellows I'd do something
to-night, and I must, you know.'</p>

<p>'Do something!' repeated his sister,
'what do you want to do?'</p>

<p>'I don't want to do anything. The poor
beggar might stay at Torrington's for ever if
he liked; but you see the others have set their
faces against it, and they say I must either
make the pater remove him, or else think of
another plan to get rid of him. Don't you see,
Duffy, I must do one or the other?'</p>

<p>'No, I don't see; and you shan't call me
Duffy either, if you mean to help these
wretched cads at Torrington's, and I'll never
own you for a brother again!' His sister spoke
calmly, but with the utmost scorn and contempt
in her tones, and then laid her head on the
table and burst into tears. 'I'm ashamed of
you, I am!' she sobbed through her tears.</p>

<p>Leonard stared at her in silent amazement
for a minute or two, and then said slowly, 'You
don't know this scholarship boy, do you?'</p>

<p>She shook her head. 'Of course I don't,'
she said, as soon as she could speak.</p>

<p>'Then what are you crying for? I'd be
ashamed to cry for a fellow I'd never seen;
and you a girl too!'</p>

<p>Florence started to her feet as her brother
uttered this taunt; and dashing away her tears,
with blazing eyes she exclaimed, 'It is not for
this strange boy I am crying, but for <i>you</i>&mdash;that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
you are as much a cad as Taylor and the
rest!' Then, gathering up her books, she
marched out of the room with the air of an
offended duchess.</p>

<p>'Ah, you're only a girl!' exclaimed
Leonard as she departed; and he broke into
a whistle, but it soon ended in a sigh, when the
door closed and he was left to himself.</p>

<p>'I wonder what girls are made of,' he said,
as he slowly opened his lesson books. 'To
think of Duffy flying at me like that! She
called me a cad too, nasty little thing! I
won't speak to her for a week, when we come
in here to lessons. I'll give her a taste of
Coventry, and see how she likes it.' And
Leonard set himself to master a Latin verb.
But before he had conned it three minutes his
thoughts had wandered to his sister, and from
her to Taylor and the lads at school, who
expected him to solve the problem that they
had made into a bogey&mdash;how to get rid of the
scholarship boy, since all their efforts thus far
had failed.</p>

<p>Before he got to school the next morning
he met half a dozen of his schoolfellows.</p>

<p>'Well, what's the news, Morrison?' asked
two or three in a breath. 'You know,
of course, Taylor expects you to bring a
message from your father about that fellow
to-day.'</p>

<p>'Blessed are they that expect nothing, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
they shall never be disappointed,' said Leonard
in a tantalising tone.</p>

<p>'Well, you can cheek us, of course, little
Morrison, but it won't do for Taylor, let me tell
you. He don't mean to stand any nonsense.
That fellow's got to go. We don't mean to have
any board school boys here. Torrington's
was founded for gentlemen, and we don't mean
to have cads here. We've made up our minds
about it, and the sooner your father and that
precious Council understand this the better.'</p>

<p>'Did Taylor tell you to say all that?'
said Morrison sneeringly, 'How long have
you been his fag?' he asked of the lad who
had spoken.</p>

<p>'Oh, well, fag or no fag, you'll know it
when Taylor comes.' And, as if in verification
of his words, Taylor called to them the next
minute to wait for him.</p>

<p>'We're late now,' shouted Leonard back,
and then he started off at a sharp pace towards
the school, for he had not quite made up his
mind yet what he should tell Taylor, by way
of excuse for not speaking to his father, and
so he did not want to meet him just now.</p>

<p>He could not help noticing, as he ran,
that none of the rest attempted to join him,
but waited at the corner of the road they
had been crossing for Taylor to come up.</p>

<p>'So Morrison has skulked off,' he said, as
soon as he joined them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>'I believe he wanted to get out of your
way,' said one.</p>

<p>'I shouldn't wonder,' said the bigger lad;
'but he need not think he's going to do it.
I tell you that I've been ferreting out things a
bit, and I know now that it was Dr. Morrison
that persuaded the County Council to send
that fellow to Torrington's, and so he must
and shall take him away, and that pretty
soon too, and I mean to tell Morrison that.'</p>

<p>'How are you going to do it?' asked one.</p>

<p>'Oh, through Morrison junior, of course.
There isn't much spunk about him, and he'll
soon cry Peccavi! when we put the screw on.'</p>

<p>'What will you do&mdash;how will you do it?'
asked one.</p>

<p>'Send him to Coventry as we did the
other,' was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>'Oh, that be bothered; we can't be worried
with two there at once. You must think of
something else.'</p>

<p>'Bless you, the threat of it will be enough
for little Morrison. He'll give in when he
hears the mystic word Coventry!'</p>

<p>'You'll give him another chance it he
hasn't brought the message?'</p>

<p>'Well, I shall hear what he's got to say
first. Now look alive, there's the last bell,
and we shall all get an imposition instead of
a pleasant talk with little Morrison, if we
don't get inside that gate.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>As he spoke the heavy clang of the school
gate was heard, and the boys looked at each
other as Taylor ejaculated, 'Dash it all! they
haven't rung that last bell two minutes, and
that's the regulation time.' They propped
their backs against the wall and rested after
their run, for the gate would not be opened
again until prayers were over in school, and
then their names would be taken as they
went in, and an extra lesson would be exacted
from them in the dinner hour.</p>

<p>'Don't let little Morrison get off without
seeing me in the afternoon,' said Taylor. 'I
sha'n't be able to nail him in the dinner hour,
but it will give me a bit more time to think
of some other plan.'</p>

<p>'It's a beastly shame they ever sent that
scholarship boy to Torrington's!' said another
lad, as though he did not like the task of
hunting him out.</p>

<p>'Oh, well, he's here, and we must get him
out,' said Taylor, as though he rather liked
the hunt. Just then the gate opened, and the
lads filed in. Nearly a dozen were late from
the whole school; and each as he passed was
asked if he had brought a note to excuse this
breach of the rule, and then they passed on to
their different class-rooms instead of going to
the hall for prayers.</p>

<p>The being late and consequent imposition
of an extra lesson did not improve Taylor's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
temper, and when he met Leonard at the
close of afternoon school he was in a towering
rage.</p>

<p>'Now, then, Morrison, out with it! What
message has your father sent to the school for
his abominable behaviour&mdash;what has he to say
for himself?'</p>

<p>Leonard looked a little scared at the
abruptness and tone of this question, and he
answered very quietly, 'My father was busy
last night, and I could not speak to him
about it.'</p>

<p>'Busy, was he? Well, it won't be good
for you if he's busy to-night, let me tell you,
for the school don't mean to wait any longer,
and if that fellow isn't soon removed, you shall
both go. Do you hear, little Morrison, we
mean to clear the school of all vermin at
once?'</p>

<p>'Why didn't you tell him to take himself
off?' said one, when Taylor had walked away.
'This is getting a bit too much. You stand
up for yourself and your father, if he comes any
more of that bullying. What right has he to
say who shall come to Torrington's? If he
had spoken of my father like that, he should
have had a black eye, if he killed me for it
afterwards!' added his friend.</p>

<p>Leonard sighed, 'You don't know Taylor
as well as I do,' he said. 'He isn't a bad sort
of fellow, if you let him have his own way.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>'But it's such a beastly way that I wouldn't
put up with it,' said the other. 'He may
be "the cock of the walk," but he need
not think we are all going to cackle to
him like a set of hens. I mean to
take that fellow out of Coventry after this.
Come on, let us both walk home with him a
bit, and see how the cock likes that. There's
Howard just ahead; let's catch him.'</p>

<p>But instead of quickening his pace Leonard
looked timorously back; and there was Taylor
with a group of lads round him vigorously
declaiming against the County Council for
sending one of their scholarship boys to Torrington's.
So Leonard felt afraid to join this
unpopular scholar, and set himself in defiance
of the present wave of anger that was passing
over his friends, and he turned down a by-road
and walked home by himself.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Dr. Morrison</span>.</h2>


<p><span class="sp1">L</span>eonard Morrison found himself
sent to Coventry, not by his schoolfellows,
but by his sister. It was just
the punishment he had decided she deserved
for daring to have an opinion of her own that
differed from his, and so to find himself 'hoist
with his own petard' made him very angry.</p>

<p>'Where is Flo going to do her lessons
to-night?' he asked his mother, when he went
to the study and found it in darkness. His
sister usually lighted the lamp ready for him,
but his mother had come with him to do it
to-night.</p>

<p>'She has gone to her own room&mdash;she
wants to be quiet, she says. You should not
talk so much, Lenny dear,' added the lady.</p>

<p>'Nasty little thing! She has been telling
tales, I suppose?'</p>

<p>'She did not say what you had been
talking about, if that is what you mean,' said
Mrs. Morrison, 'but your father heard a great
deal of chatter, he says.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>'So Flo has taken herself off,' said Leonard,
as he took his seat and opened his school
satchel. 'A nice time I shall have, if Taylor
keeps his word and sends me to Coventry at
school! I shall lose the use of my tongue in
about a week, if nobody will speak to me.
It's a lively look-out, any way, and what
have I done to deserve it, I should like to
know?'</p>

<p>Leonard considered himself a very ill-used
individual just then, and he was specially
angry with his sister because she had so neatly
turned the tables upon him in leaving him to
do his lessons alone.</p>

<p>He missed her sadly as the time went on,
and there was no one to grumble at or ask
advice from. What to do about speaking to
his father he did not know, and at last he
decided to say something to his mother about
the matter; not that he meant to tell her all,
but he would just ask her if she thought
Taylor was right in his statement.</p>

<p>So when Mrs. Morrison came into the room
with his slice of cake for his supper, he said,
'Do you know whether father had anything
to do with sending that scholarship boy to
Torrington's?'</p>

<p>'Why&mdash;isn't he a good boy?' said the lady.</p>

<p>'That isn't it, mother. He may be good&mdash;I
dare say he is&mdash;but did father send him
there?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>'The County Council sent him; your father
would not have the power.'</p>

<p>'I suppose not,' said Leonard in a satisfied
tone.</p>

<p>'But why did you ask, my boy?' said
the lady.</p>

<p>'Oh, it doesn't matter,' said Leonard,
lightly. 'As long as daddy didn't send him
it's all right.'</p>

<p>'But what has happened? What sort of
a boy is he?'</p>

<p>'Oh, he's all right, I dare say. Boys can't
peach, you know, mother.'</p>

<p>And Leonard's light words sent his mother
out with an aching heart.</p>

<p>'More trouble, I fear,' she said softly to
herself, as she closed the door and went back
to the dining-room. 'Poor Dick! poor, dear
Dick! What misery he has brought to us
all! And yet he was never wicked&mdash;only
weak.'</p>

<p>The lady buried her face in her handkerchief
for a few minutes, but roused herself
when she heard the street door open and
close, and went and rung the bell for supper
to be served.</p>

<p>'You are late to-night, dear,' she said,
when her husband entered the room.</p>

<p>'Yes, I have had a busy day, and am as
hungry as a hunter. Chicks gone to bed, I
suppose, he added, as he looked round the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
room before going to wash his hands and
change his coat for a comfortable hour by his
own fireside.</p>

<p>A tasty hot supper was on the table when
he came back, but he noticed as he ate that
his wife scarcely touched hers; but he did
not ask what was troubling her until the
meal was over and the table cleared. Then
he said, leaning back in his chair&mdash;</p>

<p>'Now, little woman, I have done my duty
to your nice supper, which I know is all you
have been waiting for. Now tell me what
is amiss. Has Flo cut her finger, or Len
got into mischief?' he asked.</p>

<p>'No, dear, the children are all right,' said
Mrs. Morrison, with a sigh; 'but I have
been wondering whether you were wise to
get that little board school boy sent to Torrington's.
You did have a good deal to do
with it, I know,' added the lady.</p>

<p>'To be sure I did. The lad had fairly
earned the Thompson Scholarship, and, from
all we heard of the lad and his relatives, we
thought he would be an acquisition to the
school rather than otherwise. His mother
was a patient of mine about a year ago, and
from all I saw then I concluded that they
were people who had come down in the
world, for it was easy to see that they were
superior to their surroundings, and I thought
then that if ever it was in my power to help<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
them I would do so. The father is abroad,
travelling, I understand; but he seems to
have left his family badly provided for.
What have you heard about the boy?'</p>

<p>'Oh, nothing,' promptly replied Mrs. Morrison.
'Only from a word Lenny dropped I
fancy he is not popular at the school, and
you know what queer notions people take
sometimes; and if it was said that Dr. Morrison
sent a board school boy to the school
they are all so proud of, we might have all
our old troubles over again.'</p>

<p>The doctor laughed. 'You think half
my patients must be offended as well as the
boys at Torrington's! I have heard a whisper
that some of them don't like the new scholar;
but he will live it down, I daresay, and I am
not going to notice it.'</p>

<p>'But, my dear, if you should lose your
patients? If this boy should disgrace himself,
people will be sure to say that you had no
business to send him to such a school, and
the worst of the trouble is sure to come
upon us.'</p>

<p>'Ah, I see you have been saddling the
horse ready to go and meet it! How many
times am I to tell you, little woman, to wait
until the trouble comes to you, and then to
look it squarely in the face and fight it, if
fighting is likely to do any good, and if it
is not, then bear it with all the patience and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
courage that God will give you, if you only
do your share in the matter? Now what has
Master Len been saying about this lad?'</p>

<p>'He asked if it was true that you were
the means of sending that scholarship boy to
Torrington's. The boys had said you did it.</p>

<p>The doctor laughed. 'Murder will out,
you see, Maria.'</p>

<p>'I told him the County Council sent him,
and of course they did.'</p>

<p>'Quite true; but I had the casting vote
in the matter, and I voted that the lad should
go to Torrington's, both for the sake of the
school and the boy, and also that I might
hear incidentally from Len what sort of a lad
he was. What does he say?'</p>

<p>'Nothing definite. He wanted to know
whether it was true that you had sent him,
and when I asked why, he said boys were not
allowed to tell tales, or words to that effect.</p>

<p>The doctor smiled. 'Then it's nothing
very bad,' he said, 'and if this lad can only
hold his own among some of those big louting
lads, he will do our school a world of good.'</p>

<p>'How is he to do that?' asked the lady.</p>

<p>'Why, this boy has formed the habit of
steady application to the task before him,
whatever it may be. If he had not, he could
not have passed the examination necessary to
gain this scholarship. Now Torrington's sadly
needs a few lads like this, for it is beginning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
to suffer from the dry rot that a great name
often brings to a school after some years.
The sons of wealthy men are sent there, who
have no need to toil with either hands or
brains, and they take care not to do it
themselves, and to hinder others from doing
it if they can. For Len, and lads like him,
this example is bad; and so to introduce a
studious lad, who will think less of games than
of lessons, has become a necessity, if Torrington's
is to be saved from going to the dogs;
and I should be very sorry to see the school
go down. I went there when I was a lad,
and have always been proud of Torrington's,
and that is why I am anxious to save it from
collapse.'</p>

<p>'I believe Lenny is just as proud of it as
you are,' said his wife.</p>

<p>'I should hope so. I don't think much of
a lad who is not proud and fond of his school,
and ready to fight for its honour against all
antagonists.'</p>

<p>'I think all Torrington's lads feel the same
about their school,' said Mrs. Morrison. 'But
suppose some of them should think a poor
boy, who is dependent upon a scholarship
for his schooling, beneath the rest of the
scholars? I cannot forget the old trouble,'
she added.</p>

<p>'Then they must learn to know better!
Learn to consider that there is something more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
in the world than money worth consideration.
This is what I am afraid is spoiling some of
the Torrington boys just now, and it is high
time it was checked. We talked this aspect
of the matter over at the Council meeting&mdash;for
there are several old boys among us who are
proud of our school&mdash;and we agreed that a
little new blood among these purse-proud young
gentlemen would do them a world of good,
and I hope this boy may be what is needed
among them. As for the old trouble,' went on
Dr. Morrison, 'that is left behind, I hope; but
you must remember that it arose from a very
different cause. Your brother Dick behaved
very badly to more than one of my patients,
and so disgraced us.'</p>

<p>'Poor, dear Dick!' said the lady with a
sigh; 'I am sure he never intended to do us
any harm.'</p>

<p>'I never thought he did. No one who
knew Dick would think that of him; but the
misery came to us all the same, and Dick was
responsible for it.'</p>

<p>This allusion to her brother brought the
tears to Mrs. Morrison's eyes. He had been
such a bright, winning lad. When he was the
age of Leonard he had only one fault that she
would admit, even now, and that was that he
was too easily led. He could not say 'No,'
though not to say it and abide by it under the
circumstances was wrong. This ended at last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
in what was little less than a crime, for which
they had to pay the penalty in a long struggle
against adverse circumstances, and eventually
to leave Liverpool, and return to Mr. Morrison's
native town and begin the world afresh.</p>

<p>This ending to what might have been a
bright and honourable career for her brother,
and a no less prosperous one for her husband,
was a very bitter trial to the lady; and though
Dr. Morrison's practice was now steadily
increasing, anything that rendered him less
popular might bring back the old trouble she
feared.</p>

<p>In thinking thus she, of course, exaggerated
the circumstances in every way, for,
in point of fact, not even Mrs. Howard knew
that it was through the doctor's influence
that Horace was sent to the same school
with his own son; and as the name of
Morrison was not mentioned by Horace, she
did not know that he was there for some
time. Her son was industrious and fond
of scientific study, and had fairly won the
scholarship, she was assured by the schoolmaster.
He was very proud to add that
Horace was the first scholarship boy who had
been sent by the County Council to Torrington's.
But that her doctor had had anything
to do with the selection of a school for Horace
she knew nothing.</p>

<p>She heard afterwards that it was the best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
school in the county; but she thought more
of whether Horace would be able to do the
lessons required of him, without overworking
himself, and also whether she would be able
to keep him suitably clothed, so that he did
not look particular among the other lads.</p>

<p>The school was nearly two miles from
their home, so that he would wear out his
boots very fast, she reflected, when considering
ways and means. There was a small
allowance made for this, after the school
fees were paid out of the scholarship money,
and it was the consideration of this that made
Horace resume wearing the old jacket, when
his mother wished him to keep on with his
best one, which he had worn for the first
week or two.</p>

<p>In fact, he had worn the best jacket until
he was so mysteriously sent to Coventry,
and though he carefully kept this fact to
himself, it was the underlying meaning of
what he told her when he said it would make
no difference to him at school whether he
wore a new or an old jacket.</p>

<p>Of the bitterness underlying the words
that were said, that she should not spend too
much on his clothes, she knew nothing.
Indeed, after the first week or two Horace
was very reticent about what passed at school,
rarely mentioned a schoolfellow by name, and
seemed absorbed in his lessons all the even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>ing.
He talked sometimes to Fred about his
mysterious idea, which she knew was connected
with chemistry; but beyond this she knew
very little of her boy's life at this time.
Sometimes he looked worried as he sat poring
over his books, as though they were a little
beyond his power, she thought; and then she
would say, 'Now, Horace, if you are getting
tired, give it up. You know going to this
school is quite an experiment for you, and
if you fail to keep up with the rest it will
be no disgrace to own it. You have been
looking pale the last day or two.'</p>

<p>'I feel quite well, mother; and as to
keeping up with the rest, well, you should
see the young giant who is always at the
bottom of the class.' And Horace laughed
as he mentally recalled the perpetually yawning
figure of Curtis, with his back propped against
the wall. 'I believe he would go to sleep
outright if it wasn't for the master saying,
"Now, Curtis, keep your ears and eyes open!"'</p>

<p>'Poor fellow! perhaps he does not feel
able to do the work,' said Mrs. Howard
pityingly.</p>

<p>'Well, he doesn't let lessons trouble him
much. He and "the cock of the walk," that's
another big chap who doesn't care much about
books, they take it pretty easy, except when
they get an "impot," and that takes all their
dinner time.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>'And what do you do at dinner time?'
asked his brother at this point.</p>

<p>'Eat my dinner, to be sure,' answered
Horace.</p>

<p>'Well, you don't look much the better for
it. Mother, I'm going to be paid an extra
shilling a week, and I vote it goes in dinners
for the boy with an idea,' said Fred.</p>

<p>'No! No! I can do very well, and I
enjoy my dinner hours now, for I often go
up to the "lab.," and have a nice time to
myself. Mr. Skeats told me I might go, if
I did not take any of the other boys with
me. You see, some of them might get up
to larks, and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Why don't you get up to larks?'
interrupted his brother.</p>

<p>Horace laughed, 'Oh, you know that
isn't much in my way, and there's room for
everybody in a big school like Torrington's.'</p>

<p>'I wish the youngster did not look so
serious,' said Fred, after his brother had gone
to bed that night.</p>

<p>'He always was quiet,' remarked his
mother.</p>

<p>'Quiet, yes; but now he looks up from
his book sometimes, as though he had a world
of care upon his mind.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps he is thinking over his "idea."
You know he could talk of nothing else for
a day or two,' said Mrs. Howard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>'Well, he doesn't talk much now, at any
rate, and I am wondering whether he is quite
happy at that school.'</p>

<p>'But surely he would tell us if he was not.
I have asked him again and again. I think
he would tell us if there was anything wrong.'</p>

<p>'Now, mother, don't vex yourself, or I
shall be sorry I have spoken. Just let that
extra shilling a week I am to have go for
the youngster's mid-day meal. Get him something
better than bread and butter to take
with him&mdash;sandwiches or a little meat-pie.
They say people who work with their brains
want as much to eat as those who work with
their hands, and I am sure two slices of bread
and butter wouldn't satisfy me at twelve
o'clock.'</p>

<p><span class="sp1">'M</span>other, I think I shall be obliged
to wear that other jacket to go to
school,' said Horace one evening as
he ate his dinner.</p>

<p>He had come home from school looking
almost radiant, and his mother had heard
incidentally that one of the other boys had
walked most of the way with him.</p>

<p>'But I thought you said no one lived
this way?' said Mrs. Howard.</p>

<p>'Oh, I think Warren came out of his
way a bit that we might finish our talk! He
likes history awfully, and so do I a bit, and
we got talking about those old battles, and
almost forgot the time. Now, mother, don't
you think I had better take my best jacket
for school? The sleeves of this are getting
so short.'</p>

<p>His mother laughed.</p>

<p>'Why, I told you the same thing a month
ago,' she said, 'but you insisted that it did
not matter!'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>'Well, you know, I don't want to cost
you more than I am obliged for clothes, and
I thought I might wear the old jacket a bit
longer, as I should wear out so many boots;
but now&mdash;&mdash;'  And there Horace stopped,
lest he should say something that might
betray how his schoolfellows had treated him
lately.</p>

<p>'You must be careful to wear the linen
apron and sleeves while you do your chemistry
work,' remarked his mother, 'for you are
beginning to make the old one a variegated
colour.'</p>

<p>'All right, I'll be careful; but I thought
Warren looked at my hands poking too far
through the sleeves of that old one, and
Warren is a nice fellow; I should not like to
hurt his feelings,' said Horace.</p>

<p>'Ah! you find that some lads are more
particular about their clothes than you are.
Yes, wear the best jacket by all means, and
I have no doubt I shall be able to buy you
a new one when you want it.'</p>

<p>So the matter was settled, and the next
morning he met his new friend as they had
arranged, and the two boys had a pleasant
chat on all sorts of subjects as they walked
along the road. Just before the school was
reached, and when they came within sight of
other groups of boys, Horace stopped short,
and said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>'Now you had better go on; it don't
matter if I am late, I have plenty of time in
the dinner hour to do the imposition.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean&mdash;what do you take
me for?' said Warren, thrusting his arm
through his companion's.</p>

<p>'Well, you know the school have sent me
to Coventry lately; and if you know what
for, it's more than I do, so that it isn't
likely to alter its opinion in a hurry,' said
Horace.</p>

<p>'Oh, the school be bothered!' said Warren.
'Of course a fellow has to do the same as
the rest when he is at school, but "the cock
of the walk" is going a bit too far this time,
and I mean to let the whole lot see that I
won't follow the lead, when I don't think it's
fair and square. If they had any good reason
for sending you to Coventry, I'd see you
hanged before I'd try to take your part; but
I like fair play, and it is not a fair game they
are playing against you now.'</p>

<p>'But suppose they send you to Coventry
as well?' said Horace.</p>

<p>'Oh, they will, you bet. Taylor and
Curtis and that crowd are sure to do it, and
I dare say they will rage like a bull in a
china shop. Come on here. They see we
are going in arm-in-arm.'</p>

<p>A storm of hisses greeted their appearance
at the school gate, and Horace changed colour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and his arm shook; but Warren gripped
him the tighter, so that he could not get
away.</p>

<p>'Is it worth while sticking to me if the
rest don't like it?' whispered Horace.</p>

<p>'Is anything worth fighting for as those
old Englishmen fought in the Civil War&mdash;Hampden
and that lot?' Warren's face was
flaming, and he held his head high, as he
led Horace through the hooting crowd of
boys, while he asked this question loud
enough for any of them to hear.</p>

<p>Horace did not answer. He almost wished
Warren would leave him alone. But this was
not that gentleman's way. 'I tell you what
it is, Howard,' he said, when they had reached
the comparative shelter of the playground,
where the hooting had to cease, for fear the
master should insist upon knowing what it
was about. 'I have been thinking a lot of
what we were talking about last night, and
it's my opinion that there would not be so
many tyrants in the world if they did not
find easy victims. You knuckled under to
"the cock of the walk" at the first touch,
when you ought to have said, "Now, what
do you mean by sending me to Coventry?
What rule of the school have I broken?"'</p>

<p>'Ah, but you know we are not rich people.
I am only a scholarship boy, and come from
a board school.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>'As if I didn't know that. As if my pater
has not told me a dozen times lately that he
wishes he had sent me to a board school
when I was young. Bless you, we are not
rich. My father is only a doctor, like Morrison's,
and there are swarms and swarms of
children in the nursery, so you may know
we haven't got money to roll in, like Curtis.
No, old fellow, we are two poor boys, and
so we'll just stand shoulder to shoulder, and
fight the lot, if they want to fight us. Now
mind, you've got to fight for me, and I'll
fight for you; and we'll let 'em see what
two can do, if nobody else joins us. Little
Morrison will, though I think Taylor has led
him a dog's life lately; and so I should think
he would be glad enough to cut that shop,
and join Howard and Co.'</p>

<p>Horace laughed as he had not done since
he had been at Torrington's. He was ready
enough to fight for his new friend, and when
one or two tried to hustle them apart as they
were going to school, he did not hesitate to
push one of them off, when he was crowding
down upon Warren.</p>

<p>The boy turned and scowled at Horace.
'Who are you?' he demanded angrily.</p>

<p>'The scholarship boy, and this is my
friend,' he said, still holding on to Warren,
and dealing some sharp thrusts at those who
were trying to push between them. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
could be no great demonstration here in
the lobby of the school, or the masters
would want to know what the quarrel was
about.</p>

<p>At dinner time there was little opportunity
for the new friends to meet, for the science
master, if he did not know, shrewdly guessed
the attitude taken by the rest of the class
towards the scholarship boy, and so had
contrived to find something for him to do in
the chemistry laboratory during the recess;
and Horace was only too glad of the change
to do a little extra practical work towards
the elucidation of his idea, which grew all the
more interesting, as he saw it would need
great care and industry to arrive at the
result.</p>

<p>But when afternoon school was over
Warren waited about until Horace appeared,
and then he said, 'Just go on a little way,
while I speak to Morrison. I want him to
come with us, for I know that "cock of the
walk" is bullying him, and if he'll just join
us we shall be three to the other lot. Little
Morrison isn't a bad sort of fellow, when
you can get him to make up his mind,
and the Curtis lot are getting a deal too
cocky.'</p>

<p>So Horace walked on to the corner of the
road, and Warren waited for Leonard; but
the moment Taylor saw him speak to the lad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
he pounced down upon him. 'Now look
here, Morrison,' he said, 'if you go talking
to Warren now he's joined that fellow in
Coventry, you'll be sent there yourself by
the rest of the school. I'll give you a week
to think over what we were talking about
at dinner time;' and Taylor, as he spoke,
slipped his arm into Leonard's and walked
him off, leaving Warren to try and persuade
another boy to join him in his walk home
with Horace.</p>

<p>But the Taylor and Curtis party were too
strong just now for another to rebel against
their rule, and so the two lads walked home
by themselves, amid the derisive cheers of
Taylor and a few others.</p>

<p>This state of things continued for a few
days&mdash;the two friends learning to know and
like each other better each time they met, and
cared less for the company of others. Then
a quarrel broke out in the ranks of the popular
party, and Warren heard that Taylor was so
hectoring the others as to what they should
do, that at last, out of sheer perversity, two
or three came to walk home with them, and
held a discussion concerning Taylor and his
ways that ought to have made that young
gentleman's ears tingle.</p>

<p>'We're all in Coventry now, of course,'
said one boy, 'and I vote that we make ourselves
jolly over it. I say, Howard, I want<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
you to tell me how you get your lessons
done, for you're always ready with an answer,
and I've been so floored lately that I've had
a private message if I don't do better I shall
have to go down among the juniors, and that
would make my people wild.'</p>

<p>Horace laughed at the idea of there being
any royal road to the acquisition of lessons
but the one of careful, steady, thoughtful
study.</p>

<p>'Then you do swat awfully, as the fellows
say, and that's what they are so mad about.
Taylor says Torrington's will be nothing better
than a swatting shop, and no place for gentlemen,
if it isn't stopped.'</p>

<p>Horace opened his eyes. 'I thought we
went to school that we might learn all we
could!' he said.</p>

<p>'Oh, Torrington's has got so fashionable
that fellows have come to think of it as an
easy-going place, where they need not work if
they don't like it.'</p>

<p>'Just what my pater says!' exclaimed
Warren. 'And he told me that if I didn't
turn over a new leaf he should send me
somewhere else. Now I propose we make
ourselves into a swatting club. I believe
Mr. Mason would be glad if we did.'</p>

<p>'I'm sure Skeats would,' said another.</p>

<p>'Well, there are six of us here. Suppose
we agree that we'll stick to our work of an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
evening till we've got our lessons perfect for
the next day.'</p>

<p>'Won't Taylor be mad when he finds it
out!' said another. But, as Taylor had offended
them, the suggestion added piquancy to the
notion. And so before they separated each
pledged himself to join the new swatting
club. It was not an elegant name for a party
of students to call themselves, but the object
of the combination was good, and was warmly
commended by the parents, who were taken
into the confidence of their sons.</p>

<p>If the little party of students thought they
were going to have an easy time of it at school,
they were mistaken; for Taylor and the more
popular party soon found out by the answers
given in the classes what the new combination
meant, and he was more angry than
ever.</p>

<p>'A parcel of beggars who set themselves
up to be gentlemen have no business at
Torrington's; and the sooner they take themselves
off the better!' he exclaimed angrily,
when discussing this new departure with a few
of his chosen friends.</p>

<p>Warren overheard what he said, and was
not averse to a duel of words with 'the cock
of the walk.'</p>

<p>'Who do you call gentlemen?' he demanded&mdash;'those
who live in glass houses, and
the son of a man who used to keep&mdash;&mdash;'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Taylor did not wait to hear more. Before
the objectionable word could be spoken
Warren received a blow that felled him to the
ground.</p>

<p>It came so unexpectedly and was struck
so unfairly that there was an instant cry
of, 'Coward! coward! Fight it fair and
square!'</p>

<p>'All right, let him come on,' said Taylor.
But Warren was in no fit condition to stand
up to his antagonist just now, for he had struck
his head as he had fallen, and lay for a minute
or two quite unconscious. Some of the boys
grew alarmed, and all were glad to see the boy
open his eyes and the colour slowly return
to his face. They were outside the school
premises when the incident occurred, and they
all took care to walk away as quickly as they
could, lest the master's attention should be
called to the quarrel, and they be compelled
to give an account of it, which would not have
been at all to their taste, as they preferred to
manage their own affairs in their own way, with
as little interference from the masters as
possible in what they regarded as their own
private business.</p>

<p>Taylor was one of the first to walk off when
he saw Warren was getting better, and the
rest, who had hoped to enjoy the spectacle
of a fight, were disappointed. There were
plenty to urge Warren to 'take it out' of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Taylor another day, and plenty more to side
with the bigger lad, and urge him to 'have it
out' with Warren for his 'cheek' in daring
to dispute the authority of the majority of
the class, and speak to the scholarship boy
when he had been sent to Coventry.</p>

<p>Leonard Morrison was one of the foremost
in urging Taylor to fight it out.</p>

<p>'The school expects it of you,' urged
Leonard. 'He said your father was&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Shut up, will you!' snarled Taylor,
turning his angry gaze upon Leonard. 'If
he has taken that fellow out of Coventry, it
was a plucky thing to do in the face of the
whole class, and I like pluck,' he added,
'though I may get the kicks.'</p>

<p>It was plain that 'the cock of the walk'
was seriously hurt or alarmed by what Warren
had said, for he ceased to crow as loudly as
usual, and walked home without noticing what
his satellites said, his eyes bent on the ground,
and evidently lost in thought over something
that disturbed him more than the prospect of
a fight with Warren.</p>

<p>Of course, as this was the latest phase of
the scholarship boy question, it occupied more
of the thought and attention than the earlier
question; and so Horace walked into school
the next morning chatting with one or
two others, and no protesting hisses were
raised.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>It was noticed that Warren was not with
him, and he looked round anxiously from
time to time in search of his friend. But the
day passed, and he did not appear, and the
boys' spirits were damped a little in consequence,
for they remembered now that they
had heard that a blow on the head might
prove dangerous to Warren.</p>

<p>But, to the relief of everybody, the two
friends were seen coming along the road
together the next morning, and when Taylor
appeared round a bend in the road Warren
walked up and joined him.</p>

<p>'Look here, Taylor, I had no business
to say what I did the other day, for I can't
fight you, it seems. My father has forbidden
it, because&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Then you won't repeat what you said
the other day?' interrupted Taylor eagerly.</p>

<p>'What do you take me for? I should be
a cad if I did. Besides, I can see now that
I have no business to blame you for what&mdash;&mdash;No,
I'm not going to say anything,' he
whispered, in answer to Taylor's frown.
'Let every tub stand on its own bottom,
I say.'</p>

<p>'All right, old fellow, we'll let the matter
drop, then, and, mind, mum is the word
between us.'</p>

<p>'Right you are,' said Warren, and then
he ran off to join Horace, for he had drawn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Taylor aside to say this, as neither of them
wished their talk to be overheard.</p>

<p>Whatever it might be that Warren had
heard concerning the antecedents of Taylor's
family, he could not be more sensitive upon the
point than Warren was over his inability to
fight without danger to his life. For a schoolboy
to be told that he cannot stand up in a fair,
square fight without bringing the danger to his
antagonist of being charged with manslaughter,
had brought such a shock to the boy that it
was this, rather than the effects of the fall, that
made his father forbid him going to school the
previous day. The lad had wondered how he
was to get out of finishing the fight already
begun; and it demanded a greater amount of
courage on his part to walk up to Taylor and
ask him to let the matter end where it was,
than to stand up before him for a turn at
fisticuffs, even with the almost dead certainty
of getting the worst of it.</p>

<p>He had told his secret to Horace as he
came along, glad of a confidant who would
understand his difficulty; and Horace had
counselled that he should make up his quarrel
with Taylor, even though it involved throwing
him over, if Taylor should make the
demand.</p>

<p>Warren shook his head. 'I shan't do
that,' he said. 'I think we shall find another
way, and you can tell the fellows we have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
agreed to cry quits. But don't tell them I
can't stand up and fight, for fear the other
fellow should get sent to prison afterwards.
That's the dreadful part about it, and that's
what my father says would be pretty sure to
follow. What an awful muff I must be!'
sighed the boy, 'worse than any girl!'</p>

<p>'But look here, you've just done something
that took a lot more courage of another sort,'
said Horace, who was ready to make a hero of
his new friend for managing the affair with
Taylor without throwing him over. 'You did
a plucky thing too, speaking to me in the face
of all the class.'</p>

<p>'Oh, that was just part of the fight that is
in me. I believe I was born a fighter, and
now for the sake of other people I must be
mum, and go through the world like a girl.'</p>

<p>'I don't know anything about girls; I never
had a sister, so I can't tell what they are like,
but I know you will have plenty of the other
sort of courage when it is wanted, so you
need not mind much, if you can't fight with
your fists.'</p>

<p>They had reached the crowd of boys near
the gate now, and two or three pressed eagerly
forward, to know when and where the fight was
to come off.</p>

<p>'We've settled it now,' answered Warren.</p>

<p>'Bosh! Don't believe it, boys. They are
just going off to have it out by themselves.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>'You're not going to let Warren off, are
you, Taylor?' shouted another lad, as Taylor
appeared.</p>

<p>'Shut up and mind your own business, and
leave Warren and me to settle our own affairs
in our own way!' And having said this, he
pushed his way through the crowd and
marched straight into school.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">For the Honour of the School</span>.</h2>


<p><span class="sp1">'H</span>ow is your friend Warren to-day,
Len?' asked Mr. Morrison, on the
day when the boys thought the
adjourned fight ought to have come off.</p>

<p>'Warren's no friend of mine now, he's an
awful sneak!' said Leonard, angrily. He was
greatly mystified over the fight not taking
place, for he intended to support Taylor, and
at least do part of the cheering on his side;
and the collapse of the whole affair annoyed
him, and he chose to consider it was Warren's
fault. 'He just funked it you know, dad,' he
said, when he explained the matter to his
father.</p>

<p>'I don't know so much about that,' said
Mr. Morrison; 'I met his father yesterday,
and he told me he had forbidden his son to
engage in a fight, either now or at any future
time, and I asked him if he thought his son
would obey him.'</p>

<p>'"Yes, I do!" he said, and seemed quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
confident that his boy would respect his
wishes, and I wondered whether he was right.
So Warren junior refused to fight, did he?'
said Mr. Morrison. 'It was a plucky thing to
do, and I like a boy who can say "No," and
stick to it.'</p>

<p>'The fellows are saying it was beastly
mean of him, and he funked it because Taylor
is a bigger fellow.'</p>

<p>'Ah! boys often jump to wrong conclusions.
It isn't the only plucky thing Warren
has done. Have you joined the swatting
club yet, my boy?'</p>

<p>'What did you say, father?' asked
Leonard, with widely opened eyes.</p>

<p>'The formation of a swatting club is the
last new move, I hear, at Torrington's. To
swat is to study, I understand&mdash;is that right?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes, the word is right enough; but
who told you about it?'</p>

<p>'Is it a secret, then? Didn't you know
about it&mdash;haven't you been asked to join it?'</p>

<p>'No! they wouldn't ask me; it isn't likely;
for all the school know that I am trying to
keep up the honour of Torrington's&mdash;keep
it from going to the dogs, in fact,' said the
boy, loftily, but with an angry tone in his
voice.</p>

<p>'I am glad to hear it, Len. I was a
Torrington boy in my time, and I love the old
school still.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>'Then, father, what did you send that
beastly scholarship boy there for?' burst out
Leonard, scarcely knowing what he said in his
anger.</p>

<p>'Leonard! Leonard!' chided his mother.</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon, mother, but it
is what the fellows are always saying, and I
forgot.'</p>

<p>'But why should the boys be vexed that
the County Council chose to send one of the
most promising of their scholars to that
school? Has he done anything to offend
you?'</p>

<p>'We don't give him the chance, and we
want you, father, to take him away at once.
Don't you see the honour of the school
is at stake, and the fellows like Curtis and
Taylor&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>The doctor held up his hand to stop the
boy's angry flow of words. 'We won't discuss
those gentlemen, if you please,' he said.</p>

<p>'But they are always discussing it,' exclaimed
Leonard.</p>

<p>'Very foolish of them,' interrupted Mr.
Morrison. 'But now tell me what you mean
by the honour of the school, and why this
lad has endangered it.'</p>

<p>'He comes from a board school, which,
of course, is intended for poor, common
people,' answered the boy.</p>

<p>'But "poor, common people" must be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
taught, you know; and now, if they possess
the brains, they have the right to learn to
use them as well as those who are better off.
From Dr. Mason's report to the Council,
this lad has given every satisfaction while he
has been at the school, and I had hoped that
you would have made his acquaintance by
this time, and that I might have learned a
little more about him from your point of
view.'</p>

<p>Leonard shook his head. 'You must go
to Warren for that; he has chosen to take
him up in defiance of the whole school, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;' he
stopped, dimly conscious that
in his anger he had already said too much.
Mr. Morrison was called away from the table
at this point, and Leonard felt relieved that
no further questions could be asked.</p>

<p>Later he went to the little room where
lessons were learned, and found his sister
sitting in her usual place. 'Mother wished
me to come, Len,' she said, in explanation
of her presence.</p>

<p>'All right, Duffy&mdash;not that you are such
a duffer,' he added, 'and I shall try to find
another name for you.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Duffy will do. Don't waste your
time thinking about another name for me.
What's in a name after all? It's what
you are, not what name you are called
by.  I say, what is this swatting club<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
father has heard about? You never told me
about it.'</p>

<p>'Never heard of it myself before. Won't
Taylor be mad when I tell him, for if there
is one thing he hates it is swat! He says
it's low and vulgar, and not fit for a school
like Torrington's.'</p>

<p>'But you know father doesn't think that,
and I am sure you ought to know that father
is wiser than Taylor, if he is the biggest boy
in the school.'</p>

<p>'As if that made any difference! You're
just as much of a duffer as ever, to think such
a thing,' he added.</p>

<p>'Well, what is it about Taylor that
makes you call him the "cock of the
walk?" I met him at a party last week,
and I did not think much of him, I can
tell you.'</p>

<p>'Ah! that's because you are a girl, and
don't know anything. Taylor is a jolly
fellow.'</p>

<p>'Well, I'm glad he's not my brother, for
he is not very kind to his sister, and he was
quite rude to his mother. He is no gentleman,
and so he has no right to find fault
with father because he sent a board school
boy to sit with him at Torrington's.'</p>

<p>Leonard only laughed at his sister's denunciation
of his hero; but he was curious to
learn what had been said about this swatting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
club&mdash;whether she had heard it spoken of
before to-day. 'I should like to know how
long they have been at it, and who are in
it,' he said.</p>

<p>'Father said Warren and the scholarship
boy; he was telling mother about it when you
came in.'</p>

<p>'Oh, that scholarship boy is at the bottom
of the whole mischief, of course,' said Leonard;
'but I should like to know how many more
are in it; it's no good going to Taylor with
half a tale. Won't he be mad, when he hears
of this last move! Warren is forbidden to
fight, too! I wonder why that is? Something
wrong with his head, I shouldn't
wonder,' added Leonard, after a minute's
thought.</p>

<p>'Why, what makes you think that?'
asked Florence.</p>

<p>'Because when Taylor knocked him down
the other day he lay still as though he were
dead for a minute or two, and never turned
up at school all the next day. What larks
if he can't fight! I'll put Taylor on to that,
and see what he can make of it.'</p>

<p>'Len, how can you like to do such mean
things? I wish father had not told you about
it; but, of course, he never thought you
were going to peach to the rest of the school
about it, and especially to that vulgar thing
Taylor.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>'Now, Duffy, that "vulgar thing" is your
brother's chosen friend, so of course you
don't like him, for I've noticed lately that
if I like anything or anybody, you take a
dislike to them directly.'</p>

<p>'Yes, because the things and the people
you like are never nice. Mother was saying
the other day she hoped you would not grow
up like somebody she knew. I did not hear
his name, but she sighed as she said it, and
father did not smile or say anything when he
heard her say it.'</p>

<p>'Look here, Duffy, you need not talk
about those sort of things; I shall grow up
all right, never fear. What I want to know
is who are in the swatting lot besides Warren
and the scholarship boy? Find that out for
me, will you?'</p>

<p>'No, indeed, I will not, unless you promise
to join them, and I don't believe you mean to
do that, although you know father would
like it.'</p>

<p>'I wonder whether he joined a swatting
club when he went to Torrington's?' rejoined
Leonard.</p>

<p>'I will ask him when he comes home,'
replied his sister. 'Now I must begin my
lessons; I have done them better lately, my
governess says, and if I only work steadily on,
I shall get a prize at Christmas.</p>

<p>Her brother whistled. 'Half-a-crown book<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
for six months' work. That game don't pay
except for duffers,' he said in a tone of
contempt.</p>

<p>'I would rather be a duffer than some
people who think themselves so clever. Now
don't hinder me, but get on with your own
lessons, and let me learn mine,' said his
sister.</p>

<p>'Swat! swat! swat! with fingers and brain
and pen,' sung her brother, while Florence
propped her head on her hands and stared
at her book. Then the door opened, and
Mrs. Morrison appeared.</p>

<p>'Lenny, I want to have a little talk with
you. Playing again, my boy; I knew some
one else who chose to play a great deal of
his time away at school, but he has bitterly
repented it since. Perhaps you had better
take your books up to your own room, dear,'
she said, turning to Florence; 'I thought you
might help each other if you did them together
again, but when I heard Lenny singing I
knew it was no good.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Morrison said that while Florence
was gathering up her books, and when she had
gone upstairs, she took her seat facing Leonard
and had a long talk with him. She told him
what his father had heard concerning one
portion of the school; that it was becoming
almost lawless in its determination not to learn
more than the masters could force upon them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
'He told you too that he heard to-day of a few
boys who had separated themselves from this
party, and were determined to profit by the
instruction given, and learn the home lessons
to the best of their ability.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Morrison saw Leonard's lip curl
as she spoke in admiration of these lads.
'They're just a set of cads!' he muttered
under his breath.</p>

<p>'No, they are not; and it is your father's
wish, and mine too, that you should join this
section of the school, and learn your home
lessons as well as you possibly can. We do
all we can to help you, and Florence is quite
willing to come back and do her lessons here, if
you do not hinder her. Now will you promise
me, Lenny, to turn over a new leaf, and set
your mind steadily to the tasks that may be
set for you, instead of wasting your time in
play as you have done lately?'</p>

<p>'I don't mind doing my lessons,' grunted
Leonard ungraciously, 'but I don't see why
father should want me to join that scholarship
lot at school.'</p>

<p>'He wishes it because they are a steady set
of lads, and you are easily led into mischief
by your companions.'</p>

<p>'What mischief have I done?' angrily
demanded the boy.</p>

<p>'Well, I don't know that there has been
any particular mischief,' admitted his mother;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
'but your father is not very satisfied with the
way things have been going on at school lately.
You know the last report was far from satisfactory,
and your father said you were just
wasting your time, instead of learning all you
could. Now promise me, dear, that you will
make a new beginning.'</p>

<p>Leonard stared at his book and drummed
on the table in silence, and Mrs. Morrison,
feeling that she had said enough for once, rose
and left the room. She hoped that Leonard
would think over what she had said and act
upon it, although he had not given the promise
that she asked.</p>

<p>She went back to the drawing-room and
sat down to think, and her thoughts wandered
to that brother whom her son so strangely
resembled; and she prayed that God would
save her boy from wrecking his life and
bringing misery to his friends, as this beloved
brother had done.</p>

<p>Now Leonard chose to be half offended
over what his mother had said to him.
'Mother wants me to be like a duffing girl,'
he whispered to himself as she left the room.
'I wonder who it is she was telling me about.
Somebody who has got himself into a nice
scrape, and been obliged to leave England. It
was a nice thing to be told I was like this
scapegrace,' he muttered. But, in spite of his
anger, he did manage to learn something of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
lessons that night before he went to bed; and
he might have got on fairly well in class, if he
had not met Taylor early in his walk to school.
Taylor was brimming over with the importance
of a piece of news he had heard.</p>

<p>'What do you think, Morrison? There
are a lot of sneaks in the school who have set
up a swatting club without saying a word to
us about it!'</p>

<p>'Yes, I know; my pater has heard of it,
and wants me to join it.'</p>

<p>'You'll never do it, Morrison!' exclaimed
the elder lad.</p>

<p>'Not if I know it. What do you take me
for? Isn't it enough to be worried by the
masters? No, thank you; I'm going to stick
to my friends.'</p>

<p>'Yes, and you must fight with them too,
unless you want to see Torrington's ruined as
a school for gentlemen. That's what my pater
says, and I guess he knows as much as most.
He has made his pile; means I shall be a
gentleman, and that is all he cares for.
Lessons be blowed! They're all very well
for scholarship boys and such cads. Your
father ought to be ashamed of himself
ever to have sent that board school boy
among gentlemen, and the beggar will have
to go!'</p>

<p>Leonard did not reply, for he did not like
to hear any action of his father blamed, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
so he walked along in silence, while Taylor
poured out further angry denunciations until
the school was reached.</p>

<p>During the course of the class lessons that
morning it became very evident that there
was a dividing line between those who had
carefully studied their subjects and the rest
of the class. Warren, Howard, and seven
or eight other lads held the top part of the
class in all subjects, and Taylor, Morrison,
and the rest of that part kept steadily at the
bottom.</p>

<p>'I've had enough of this,' said Taylor when
they came into the playground after dinner.
'That scholarship boy is at the bottom
of the whole thing, and we must get rid
of him.'</p>

<p>'You've said that before,' grumbled
Curtis.</p>

<p>'Yes, I know I have, and I hoped Morrison
would persuade his pater to do the job
for us, as he brought him in; but it don't seem
as though he was going to move in the matter,
and so <i>I</i> shall, and little Morrison must help
me.'</p>

<p>'But what are you going to do?' asked
Leonard.</p>

<p>'That's my business. All you've got to do
is what I tell you, and to ask no questions.'</p>

<p>Curtis lifted his sleepy eyes and looked at
Taylor with a little more interest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>'What is it to be?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Well, I mean to stink him out; it will
all be done up in the stinkery.'</p>

<p>'The stinkery'&mdash;or stink-room, to give it
its proper title&mdash;was a small slip-room divided
from the laboratory by a close wooden partition
with several ventilating shafts, under which
noisome-smelling chemicals could be used
without causing any annoyance to the students
working in the general laboratory.</p>

<p>'That scholarship boy shall have enough
of his precious slops. I'll let Skeats know
whether he shall favour a fellow because the
rest of us have sent him to Coventry!'</p>

<p>'Why, what has Skeats done?' asked one
of the lads; for the science master was a
favourite among most of the boys.</p>

<p>'Can't you see what he's doing every day?
That sneak from the board school pretends
to have "an idea," whatever that may be,
and goes talking to old Skeats about it, and
so he lets him go up to the "lab." every dinner-time
to work at it. Don't you see the little
game? We can't make him feel he is in
Coventry, if he is taken out of our way. But
I am going to upset this family party, and
I mean little Morrison shall help me. It's
only fair, as his father brought the fellow
here, that he should be used to get rid of
him.'</p>

<p>'What do you want me to do?' asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Leonard, turning pale, and heartily wishing
himself out of the way.</p>

<p>'Why, you shall get the stuff we want.
Your father is a doctor, and so it will be easy
enough.'</p>

<p>'But the pater does not keep a store of
chemicals,' said Leonard.</p>

<p>'Who said he did? I said he was a
doctor, and I suppose you can't deny that,
can you?'</p>

<p>Leonard looked offended, and was turning
away, but Taylor soon fetched him back.
'Look here, little Morrison, it's no good
funking. You can do this job better than
anybody else, and you've got to do it. I
don't want you to steal your father's stuff, but
you must get two of his bottles, and go to
get what I shall tell you, and if the people
at the drug store ask you whether it is for
your father, why, of course you must say,
"Yes." Now mind, mum must be the word,
for I'm not going to tell all the crowd what
I'm going to do. Curtis is going to find
half the money, and I'll find the other half.
Here's half a sovereign. I don't know what
the things will cost, any more than the man
in the moon, but I shall want the things I
have put down in this paper; and tell them
to fasten them down tight, so that they don't
leak out; for you'll have to keep 'em in your
bag till I can use 'em to-morrow.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>'Must I get them to-night?' asked
Leonard, wishing he could tell Taylor he
would not do it.</p>

<p>'Yes, you <i>must</i>!' answered the 'cock of the
walk' in a masterful tone. 'Now, mind you
don't lose the money, and be sure you bring
the right chemicals.'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">News for Mrs. Morrison.</span></h2>


<p><span class="sp1">'O</span>h dear, how late you are for luncheon!
it always happens so, if I want you to
come home early!'</p>

<p>'Can't help it, my dear,' said Dr. Morrison,
as he began to take off his coat.</p>

<p>But his wife was too impatient to let him
do it this time. 'Come in here while they put
luncheon on the table,' she said, and she drew
him into the little room. 'I have had a letter.
Guess who it is from.'</p>

<p>But Dr. Morrison shook his head. 'I am
too hungry to guess anything,' he said. 'Is it
from the man in the moon?'</p>

<p>'Almost as wonderful,' said the lady. 'It
is from Dick, dear old Dick! I feel ready to
jump for joy.'</p>

<p>The doctor stood still and looked at his
wife in blank amazement. 'From Dick? your
brother Dick?' he said at last.</p>

<p>'Oh dear, don't speak like that, as though
the poor fellow had ever done anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
wicked! I have heard you say many times
that he was only weak, not wicked.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes, I know he is only weak; only
too ready to say "Yes," and be led into
mischief, when he ought to say "No," and
stand to it. Think what his easy-going ways
have cost us.'</p>

<p>'No, no, I can't think of that now,'
interrupted the lady. 'I can only remember
that he is my only brother, and I want you to
take me to him at once. I have not seen him
for five years,' she added, 'and he begs that
you will go to him at once, because he has a
friend with him who needs your attention at
once. He says he met with him out in the
wilds of Australia, and he has been the best
friend he ever had&mdash;that this Mr. Howard has
saved him body and soul. But he has fallen
ill, through disappointment at not receiving a
letter from his wife as soon as he landed.
That he has not heard from her for years,
because he had to leave England in a hurry, a
great many years ago.'</p>

<p>'Why, that might be written of Dick
himself,' said the doctor, with a smile.
'"Birds of a feather," you know the old
proverb!'</p>

<p>'Oh, but Dick must have altered, I am
sure, for he says that he and Mr. Howard have
both worked very hard, and made a moderate
fortune, or they would not have come home to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
England again. That is not like the old
Dick, is it?'</p>

<p>'No, my dear, for he generally let other
people do the hard work, while he dreamed of
what he would like to do. But now let me
see this letter.'</p>

<p>'Luncheon is served, ma'am,' said the
housemaid, tapping at the door at this moment.</p>

<p>The doctor and his wife were to have the
meal alone to-day, and so the servant's service
was dispensed with, that they might discuss
this wonderful letter, for wonderful it was, even
the doctor had to confess, when he had
read it.</p>

<p>There was far more about his friend, whose
wife and family he was anxious to find, than
there was about the writer himself; but the
most interesting piece of information was in
the postscript.</p>

<p>'My friend has just heard that his wife
went to live in the neighbourhood of your
town. Can you make inquiries? She has
two sons, Frederick and Horace. The latter
would be about thirteen, I think.'</p>

<p>The doctor dropped the letter and
gazed at his wife. 'I wonder whether it is
the father of that scholarship boy!' he almost
gasped.</p>

<p>'What scholarship boy?' asked Mrs. Morrison
impatiently.</p>

<p>'Why, the one that was sent from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
board school to Torrington's. His father was
entered as a traveller, I believe, and he was
said to be abroad. My dear, put your things
on, and we will drive round and see this Mrs.
Howard. She lives at that old-fashioned
cottage just outside the town.'</p>

<p>'Oh, but I want to go and see Dick!'
said the lady.</p>

<p>'And we will go, if possible; but I shall
have to see Warren first, and we must do as
Dick wishes, and inquire for his friend's wife
before we go.'</p>

<p>Dr. Morrison was not a man to let the
grass grow under his feet, and so the carriage
was ordered at once, and in half an hour they
were on their way to the cottage.</p>

<p>A very few words convinced the doctor
that he had found the lady he was seeking;
and when she had read all that was said about
her husband she readily agreed to go with the
doctor and Mrs. Morrison to London. While
the doctor went to his friend Warren, she
wrote a letter explaining something of what
had happened, and that she was going with
Dr. Morrison to London. This she sent by a
messenger to Fred at his work, asking him to
tell Horace something of what had occurred,
and also to meet his brother when he came
home to tea.</p>

<p>Fred was not a little puzzled when he
received this letter, but he asked to be allowed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
to leave a little earlier, and so managed to
reach home just as Horace appeared at the
bend of the lane.</p>

<p>'I tried to get here before you, but you
were too quick for me,' he said, when his
brother rushed in at the garden gate.</p>

<p>'Where's mother?' asked Horace, when
he saw Fred take the street-door key from his
pocket.</p>

<p>'Come indoors, and I'll tell you all I know.
Let me light the fire first,' he added. Fred had
learned to be very handy about the house, and
he soon had the fire blazing under the kettle;
and while it boiled he told Horace that a letter
had been sent to him early in the afternoon
from his mother, saying that she had just
received news of his father, who was ill in
London. 'Dr. Morrison came and told
her all about it, and he has gone to London
with her.'</p>

<p>'Dr. Morrison!' repeated Horace. 'Why,
Morrison is in my class at school; and the
doctor is his father, I know.'</p>

<p>'What sort of a fellow is young Morrison?'
asked Fred. He was handing cups and
saucers to Horace, who was setting them ready
for tea.</p>

<p>'Oh, Morrison is all right,' said Horace,
who was clattering the cups and saucers; for
he did not want to discuss his school troubles
with his brother. 'I don't see much of him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
because he likes to go with the bigger boys.
I say, Fred, do you remember our father?'
said Horace; 'he's been gone away such a long
time. We used to have a nice house and
servants when he stayed at home with us,
didn't we?'</p>

<p>'Then you remember him, Horry?' said
Fred.</p>

<p>But Horace shook his head. 'No, I don't
remember a bit about him, only that we had
a nice house a long time ago.'</p>

<p>'Well, I only remember a little,' said Fred.
'But I know he was a tall gentleman, and I
think he was a doctor. He went away to
travel, I have heard mother say, and she
thought he must be dead until Dr. Morrison
came this afternoon. I have brought home
some sausages,' announced Fred, who wanted
to change the conversation.</p>

<p>He knew so little and remembered so
little about his father and those former days;
but as he had grown older he had grown
angry that his father should leave his mother
as he had, without cause&mdash;so far as Fred
knew&mdash;and without explanation, he had heard,
and simply gone abroad to travel, leaving
them to battle with poverty as they could.</p>

<p>As time went on he had spoken less and
less of his father, but he had become certain
that there must have been some cause for his
father's disappearance, though his mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
might not know it; but in his own mind
there was a lurking fear that some disgrace
might lie hidden below the long silence. And
so, as soon as tea was over, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>'I am going out to get some things for
breakfast.'</p>

<p>So Horace was left to the comfort of his
books and the study of his lessons.</p>

<p>When Leonard reached home that same
afternoon, Florence met him with the information
that father and mother had both gone
out, and Mary the housemaid did not know
what time they would be home.</p>

<p>'Where have they gone?' asked Leonard,
for it was a rare occurrence for both to be
away at the same time.</p>

<p>Florence shook her head. 'Mary says
that James was sent with a letter to Mr.
Warren, and so I should think father
had asked him to look after some of his
patients.'</p>

<p>'Very likely,' answered her brother; and
then he took his satchel to the little room
where lessons were studied and sat down to
think.</p>

<p>He did not know whether he was glad or
sorry to hear that his father had gone out.
As he came along he had made up his mind
that it would be impossible to get bottles
from his father's dispensing-room, for he was
never allowed to go there, and it was just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
possible that his father had locked the door
before going out, in which case he could tell
Taylor that it was impossible to get the
chemicals for him, and there would be an
end of it.</p>

<p>But, although he said this, he knew there
would not be an end of it, and if he refused
at last to get what was wanted, he would be
sent to Coventry, at least by those whose
society he desired.</p>

<p>So after washing his hands before going
to tea he went to the dispensing-room, to find
out whether the door could be opened, and
found that it yielded at once. He went in
and closed the door, lest one of the servants
should come that way and see him, when
they would be sure to remind him that he
was not allowed to go there.</p>

<p>After closing the door he looked round to
see what he could find, and there by the sink
was a row of glass-stoppered bottles, evidently
filled with water for washing them. He
selected two that he thought would hold about
half a pint each, and pouring out the water he
took them to the study and hid them in a
corner out of sight, in case Florence should
decide to do her lessons with him this
evening.</p>

<p>But it seemed as though everything was to
favour him in what he knew was wrong-doing.
His sister told him at tea-time that she must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
do her lessons in her own room, for she had
an extra piece of history to study, as she was
working for the history prize to be given at
Christmas.</p>

<p>'Oh, all right,' said Leonard, with his
mouth full of bread and jam. 'It's all a girl
can do, I suppose, get a prize now and
then.'</p>

<p>'You can't do that if you are a boy!'
retorted Florence; and then there was a little
more sparring and wrangling, until the housemaid
appeared to clear the table. Florence
went upstairs to her lesson then, and Leonard
sauntered off to the little study and lighted the
gas, for it was getting dusk.</p>

<p>When the gas was lighted he went to look
at his bottles, and then saw in the corner, near
where he had hidden them, an old leather bag
of his father's. He remembered now that he
had been told he might have it for his books
when the satchel was worn out; and he
decided to take it at once. 'This is good
fortune indeed! Taylor says he'll take care
nobody finds out, if I only get the stuff there.
Taylor is a smart fellow, and so is his father,
or he could not have made a big fortune in a
year or two, as Taylor says he did. My dad
won't make one in a life-time, I'm afraid, and I
shall just have to go plodding on at hard work,
unless I can learn a thing or two from Taylor
by-and-by.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>While he had been speaking to himself he
had been wrapping each bottle up separately
in a piece of old newspaper and putting them
into the bag. Then he took the written paper
given him by Taylor and the half-sovereign,
and decided to go at once and get his bottles
filled. He must tell the chemist to seal the
stoppers down securely, or there would be such
a smell from the bag that it would betray them
before it could be got into 'the stinkery' at
school. He put a book in the bag as well as
the bottles, so that if his sister should discover
that he had been out, he could say he had been
to borrow a book from one of his schoolfellows.</p>

<p>He went out by the back gate, for he did
not want anyone to know he was going if he
could help it, and Florence might hear him
shut the front door. He knew where to go,
and as he brought his father's private bottles
and half-a-sovereign to pay for what he had,
the chemist served him without demur. He
wondered a little what the doctor could want
the chemicals for, but reflected that as Leonard
was old enough to sign his poison-book in the
regular way, and as Mr. Morrison was a well-known
practitioner in the town, there could be
no harm done in letting him have what he
wanted.</p>

<p>So Leonard walked home in triumph with
the bottles securely wrapped up in the bag.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
On his way back he met Taylor walking
arm-in-arm with Curtis, and both smoking
cigarettes.</p>

<p>'Hullo, little Morrison!' he said in a
patronising tone, as Leonard stopped them,
for they would have passed without noticing
him.</p>

<p>'This is a piece of luck!' exclaimed
the boy. 'You can take the bag now,
Taylor. The bottles and stuff are in it safe
enough.'</p>

<p>'What bottles? What stuff?' he said,
stepping back a pace, as if the proffered bag
would bite him.</p>

<p>'You know what it is,' said Leonard in
a tone of surprise.</p>

<p>'Oh no, I don't! I know nothing until
you bring me the stuff I told you about. Ta-ta!
little Morrison. Don't forget the bag in
the morning;' and the 'cock of the walk' and
his friend went on their way laughing, leaving
the boy transfixed with anger and amazement.
His first thought was that he would go and
throw the bottles in the canal just as they
were, give Taylor the change out of the half-sovereign,
and tell him where he would find
the bottles if he wanted them. He went
so far as to walk down the canal road, but
his courage evaporated before he had gone
any distance, and although he was still very
angry over the treatment he had received<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
from his chosen friend, he turned his steps
homeward, still carrying the bottles, but half
decided that he would not take them to
Taylor in the morning.</p>

<p>As he was going in at the back gate one
of the servants met him.</p>

<p>'Dear me, Mr. Leonard! how you made
me jump! There's a telegram come for you,
and Miss Florence has been hunting all over
the house to find you, for the boy said he
was to wait for an answer.'</p>

<p>The importance of having a telegram sent
to him soothed Leonard's ruffled feelings, and
he hurried in to find his sister and learn
what the message could be. 'Mother and
I cannot come home to-night&mdash;coming to-morrow.'
This was what the mysterious
yellow envelope contained by way of a
message, and Leonard read it with Florence
looking over his shoulder.</p>

<p>'There's no answer to go back,' said
Leonard, when he saw Mary looking at him.
'Go and tell the boy Father has just sent to
say that he is not coming home to-night;' and
then he went and carried the bag to the little
room, leaving Florence to read the telegram
over for her own satisfaction&mdash;as if that would
give her any more information.</p>

<p>She followed her brother to the study
and said, 'Where do you think they have
gone, Len?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>'How can I tell? I never heard of a
rich uncle, did you?'</p>

<p>His sister shook her head. 'Daddy was
an only son, I know,' she said. 'But I think
mother had a brother.'</p>

<p>'Was he a millionaire?' asked Leonard.</p>

<p>'He was a doctor, which is quite as good,
I am sure, for that is&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Flo, you're a duffer,' interrupted her
brother. 'There's nothing like millionaires
in these days, and so I hope this uncle, whoever
he may be, has made his pile, and will
leave it all to us.'</p>

<p>'But you don't know it is an uncle they
have gone to see. Father had friends in
London, and this telegram came from Westminster,
and I know that is in London.'</p>

<p>'Well, we shall hear all about it when
they come, I dare say. Now run away, little
girl, for I want to get on with my lessons,
now I have got the book I wanted.'</p>

<p>'Oh, that was what you wanted! You
boys are so careless. It is a good job you
can borrow of each other;' and Florence
went away, leaving Leonard to do his lessons
or reflect upon the strange events of the
evening.</p>

<p>After a few angry thoughts concerning
Taylor and his behaviour towards him that
evening, he began wondering once more
whether it was an uncle his parents had gone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to see, and then whether he was rich, and
would make them wealthy too. He had
never thought so much of money and what
it could do for its possessor until lately, but
Taylor and Curtis both belonged to wealthy
families, and he thought of what they could
do. He called to mind the half-sovereign
and the cigarettes he had seen them smoking,
and he had no doubt they were going to a
famous billiard-room in the town. Billiards,
cigars, and half-sovereigns made up an entrancing
picture to the boy, and he sat and
dreamed of these things, and wished he had
plenty of money, until half the evening was
gone; and although he declined to go to bed
at the usual hour, he only half knew his
lessons when he did go.</p>

<p>The next morning he started for school
in good time, for fear he should miss Taylor,
and be compelled to have those bottles on
his mind all the morning. But Taylor was
looking out for him at the corner of the
road where they usually met. He was in a
different mood this morning, and flattered
and praised the lad for having got the
chemicals without anyone finding out what
he had done.</p>

<p>'You carry the bag to the gate, and
I'll take it of you there, and no one will
ever see those bottles again, I can promise
you.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>'But how are you going to manage?'
asked Leonard.</p>

<p>'Oh, I have made my plans! I have
to work in "the stinkery" this morning,
so the thing will be easy enough when I
have once got your bottles up in the "lab.,"
and they'll go in my pockets for me to
take them up there. Oh, never fear! we
shall get rid of that board school beggar
this time, for Skeats is awfully particular
about his stuff, and he'll never forgive him
for using chemicals like these away from "the
stinkery." I know where to put them till
I want them, so you can give them to me
in a minute, and I will put them into the
pockets of this dust-coat I am carrying; I
brought it with me on purpose.'</p>

<p>Leonard breathed a sigh of relief when
the bottles were safely transferred from the bag
to the inside pockets of the fashionable coat.</p>

<p>'If the stopper should come out of that
bottle of sulphuric acid, your coat won't be
worth much,' he said, as Taylor swung the
coat over his arm.</p>

<p>'The stoppers are all right, I can see,'
he said; but still he carried the coat carefully,
and went at once to hang it up when he got
to the school.</p>

<p>The laboratory had been built at a later
date than the main body of the school, and was
reached by a flight of steps from the play<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>ground.
The room below it was used for
coats and hats and other impedimenta the
boys might bring with them, each boy having
his own peg and place on the shelf for bag or
lunch basket. They passed through this room
on their way to the laboratory, and so it would
be easy for Taylor to take down his coat, and
carry it up with him when he went for his
practical chemistry lesson, and he did this
without any notice being aroused among the
other boys.</p>

<p>At twelve o'clock, when school was over,
the science master went to the playground
to look for Howard, who was eating his
sandwiches as he walked up and down. 'You
won't be long before you go up to the
laboratory, I suppose, Howard?' he said, when
he saw the lad.</p>

<p>'No, sir, I'm going in a minute,' said the
boy.</p>

<p>'I have left three boys there finishing
their work. Just see they leave their things
all right, when you go in.'</p>

<p>Horace frequently performed such small
services for the science master, and readily
promised to do this. But just as Mr. Skeats
turned away, Warren came up, and the two
stood talking for two or three minutes before
Howard went to the laboratory. He ran up
the steps, and was surprised to find the door
closed, but not locked, as boys usually locked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
it when they were left to do some work after
school hours. When he opened the door, he
was struck by the peculiar smell of almonds
that pervaded the place. He closed the door,
but did not lock it. 'I say, what have you
fellows been using?' he said, as he went to the
further end of the room. There lay one boy
stretched out on the floor near a bench, and
close to another lay a second. He tried to
rouse the one nearest to him, and then seized
him by the legs and dragged him across the
room out on to the landing. There he shouted
'Help! help!' and ran back to pull out the
others, for he knew the deadly nature of that
almond-like smell. He managed to get
another to the door, where he would get fresh
air, and then returned for the third. He found
him lying near 'the stinkery,' and thought he
would open that door, for the better ventilation
of the outer room; but as he passed his own
bench, which stood near, he was overpowered
by the fumes pouring out of a flask standing
there, from which acid also was boiling over on
to the bench and floor. He reeled, and before
he could reach the door fell insensible to the
ground, one hand falling helplessly into the
pool of burning liquid there. But by this time
the fresh air had revived the first boy he had
dragged out, and he called to a lad in the
playground.</p>

<p>'What's the row?' said Warren&mdash;for it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
happened to be that young gentleman. 'Oh,
what a stink!' he said the next minute, and
putting his head in, he saw Howard and the
other lad lying on the floor at the further end
of the room. He knew that the fumes were
dangerous, and stuffing his pocket-handkerchief
into his mouth and up his nostrils, he dashed
in and tried to drag both boys at once
to the door, but had to drop one just as
Mr. Skeats rushed up. He picked up Horace,
and carried him down, and then sent for
the head master and other lads to carry
out those who, although somewhat revived,
were still lying on the landing at the top of
the steps.</p>

<p>'You must have a doctor, sir,' said Warren,
pushing his way through the crowd of boys
who had gathered round to know what was
the matter.</p>

<p>'Yes, yes,' said the master; and Warren
rushed off to the gate and ran hastily
down the road. He knew his father was
often in the neighbourhood about that time
of the day, and, to his great joy, he saw him
driving in his gig. The boy ran and shouted,
and speedily attracted the doctor's attention
when his son shouted, 'Something wrong in
the "lab!"'</p>

<p>He ran into the playground, and there half-a-dozen
voices called, 'They have carried them
all to the master's house.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Here he found two of the boys well-nigh
recovered, but the third one was still unconscious,
and Horace seemed even worse. His
hand and arms were badly burned with the
acid, and there were splashes of it on his
face.</p>

<p>The masters were doing what they could
to get the deadly poison out of his lungs, but
it seemed as though Horace and the third lad
had inhaled so much of the gas that all their
efforts were in vain. The doctor looked grave
when Mr. Skeats told him the boys had been
breathing hydro-cyanic acid gas. The application
of artificial respiration was redoubled, but
it was not until nearly four o'clock that Horace
began to revive, and what Leonard felt during
those awful hours of suspense could be better
imagined than described! The laboratory had
been locked up, as soon as it was known what
had happened, so that the affair might be
inquired into. No boy was allowed to go
home either, although Taylor had complained
of being very ill, and had wanted to leave
early.</p>

<p>Not until it was known that Horace was
out of all immediate danger was there a word
spoken, and then Dr. Mason said, 'I am ready
to hear any explanation that you may wish
to give me as to the cause of what has
happened. I have heard all about the attendant
circumstances and the rescue of these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
lads.  What I want to know is, who caused
the disaster?'</p>

<p>Not a sound broke the silence of the school
when the doctor had said this. Leonard was
ready to tell of his share in the affair, but as
he glanced at Taylor he received such a look
of warning as made him cower in his seat, and
the school broke up wondering what would
happen next.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Righteous Retribution</span>.</h2>


<p><span class="sp1">W</span>arren volunteered the information
that Howard's mother had gone away
from home, and only his elder brother
could take care of him, if he was sent there,
so that it was decided that he should remain
in the master's house for the present; and
Warren went to let Fred know that his
brother would not be home all night.</p>

<p>'Why, what is the matter?' asked the
young carpenter anxiously.</p>

<p>'There was something wrong in the "lab."
this dinner-time. Nobody knows just how it
happened, but there'll be a jolly row about it
to-morrow, I know.'</p>

<p>'I hope Horace had nothing to do with
it,' said Fred.</p>

<p>'Oh, didn't he, though! Three boys
would soon have been dead if he hadn't gone
in. That's how he got hurt. You can go and
see him, my father says, only you mustn't talk
much.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Fred was not long getting his tea; he was
too anxious to go and hear more of what had
happened to his brother, but he took care to
wash himself and change his working clothes
before presenting himself at the master's
house.</p>

<p>He found Horace in bed, with both hands
bandaged and looking very pale. He was able
to tell him what had happened, but begged
him not to say a word about it to his mother,
as he felt sure he should be quite well in the
morning. Fred hardly knew what to do, but
at length agreed not to say a word about it
when he wrote to his mother. When he had
nearly reached his own home, he saw a boy
waiting near the gate, and he said, 'Are you
Howard's brother?'</p>

<p>'Yes. Who are you?' asked Fred.</p>

<p>'My name is Morrison, and I want to
know if you think he will get well again.'</p>

<p>'I hope so. But why are you so anxious
about it? Do you know how it happened?'</p>

<p>Leonard nodded.</p>

<p>'I know a bit,' said the boy sheepishly,
'and I wondered whether I'd better tell my
father.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes&mdash;tell him by all means,' said
Fred eagerly. 'Come in a minute, and if you
like I will go home with you and break the
ice. I've always been in the habit of telling
my mother when I got into a scrape; but it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
made it a bit easier if Horace told her something
about it first, so I know how you feel
about telling your father.'</p>

<p>'We didn't mean to hurt the fellows, you
know,' said Leonard eagerly, as he went into
the little sitting-room. 'We didn't mean to
hurt anybody; only make a jolly stink in the
"lab.," and get somebody into a row.'</p>

<p>He did not say who the 'somebody' was,
and Fred did not ask him. They went away
together, and walked almost in silence, for
Fred did not like to press the boy to tell him
any more. It was a long walk round to
Leonard's home, but Fred did not mind; and
if the doctor had got back he might hear of his
mother, and something of what had happened
since she had been gone, for he had not had
a letter from her, as he had expected.</p>

<p>When they got to the doctor's house, and
Fred asked to see him, the servant said he had
only just come home, and she was not sure
that he could see anybody.</p>

<p>'I think he will see me, if you tell him that
my name is Howard,' said Fred. 'I have
come to see him about my brother, who was
hurt at school to-day.'</p>

<p>The doctor was certainly mystified as to
the meaning of the last part of the message,
but he was glad to see Fred, for he had
promised his mother he would see him as
soon as possible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>The doctor rose from his seat and took
Fred's hands as he entered the room. 'I
am very glad to see you. I have some
wonderful news for you. I left your father
a few hours ago. Your mother wished me
to tell you. Do you remember your father?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir, a little,' answered Fred, quite
forgetting what he actually had come for.</p>

<p>'You do remember him?' repeated the
doctor.</p>

<p>'I know he was a gentleman,' said Fred,
a little proudly.</p>

<p>'Yes, he has proved himself a steadfast,
God-fearing, humble Christian. A true gentleman
in these later years,' said Mr. Morrison;
'and I have promised him, and your mother
too, that you shall hear something of what
those years have been.'</p>

<p>'But I should like to know first why he
went away and left us all alone,' said Fred,
with reddening brow. 'It was not fair to
my mother, or to any of us, and I am not
sure that I shall ever want to see him again.'
And then the tears filled Fred's eyes.</p>

<p>'Sit down, my lad,' said the doctor; 'your
father knew that you must feel angry at what
has happened, and, to use his own words, he
does not deserve anything else at your hands,
but I was to tell his story in as few words as
possible, and leave the rest to you.</p>

<p>'Some time before he went away he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
a patient named Taylor. He seems to have
been a very fascinating sort of man, and your
father was not a very strong one. Through
this man he neglected his practice a great deal&mdash;he
was a doctor, you know&mdash;his friend
always seemed to have plenty of money, and
they went about the country a good deal
together enjoying themselves, doing no great
harm, beyond your father neglecting his work
and you at home.</p>

<p>'This lasted for some time, and then one
day his friend begged him, as a great favour, to
sign his name to a bill. Of course, by doing
this your father became responsible for the
whole amount of the debt, if his friend should
fail to repay it within the time named; but
he had such confidence in Mr. Taylor, and
believed all he said about the wealth coming
to him, that he signed it after a little persuasion,
although it was for a very large
amount of money.</p>

<p>'He never told your mother of this transaction,
because he knew she disliked and
mistrusted this Taylor.</p>

<p>'A few days before this bill became due
your father found to his dismay that his friend
had disappeared from his London house, and
no one knew where he had gone. Still, your
father said no word to your mother of what
had happened, but when he was served with
the notice that he must now pay the debt,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
he was seized with panic at the thought of the
ruin he had brought upon himself and family,
and, instead of bravely staying to do what he
could to help those who were dependent upon
him, he went out one morning, and took a
passage to Australia by a vessel that was
just leaving the docks.</p>

<p>'It must be said in excuse for him that
just at the time there was a great talk of the
rapid fortunes that were being made in the
gold-fields, and he had heard that Taylor had
gone there to make his fortune.</p>

<p>'I need hardly tell you that he did not
see his false friend again, although he heard
of him more than once during his wanderings
in the wilds of Australia.</p>

<p>'He wrote one short letter, telling your
mother he would come home as soon as he
had made his fortune; and he resolved in his
own mind not to do so until he had accomplished
this, for only in this way he thought
he could atone for the past and prove that he
was worthy of her confidence for the future.</p>

<p>'But he found the task much harder than
he had supposed, and instead of making his
fortune at the gold-fields he was robbed of
the little he possessed, and was glad to get
any sort of work that would provide him with
a crust of bread.</p>

<p>'Then he met with Mrs. Morrison's brother,
who was not unlike himself in many respects&mdash;easily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
led, weak to resist temptation&mdash;but
in the hard school of affliction to which they
had condemned themselves God met them,
and showed them the folly and sin of which
they had been guilty; and they sought and
found pardon through the Lord Jesus Christ.
Then, through the help of God's Holy Spirit,
they began to struggle against the temptations
by which they were beset, and in the struggle
grew strong, strong enough to resist even the
making of illegal gains; and so the fortune
that was to restore them to home and country
was a long time in the making, and meanwhile
they clung to each other, and to God.'</p>

<p>'But my father might have written to us,'
said Fred, still a little hardly.</p>

<p>'They both wrote to their nearest friends
in England. But you must remember that
your mother had left London, and I had left
Liverpool, where I was living when my
brother-in-law went away; so both letters
were returned, and the wanderers could only
work on in faith and hope that one day God
would bring them to their dear ones again.'</p>

<p>Fred had listened with the greatest intentness
to the doctor's story, and now he
roused himself, remembering that the errand he
had come upon had not yet been mentioned.
'Thank you, Dr. Morrison,' he said, 'for
telling me this; but I cannot help thinking
still that my father has been very cruel to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
us, although he may not have intended it;
but I came to see you about something else.
You have a son who goes to school with my
brother; Horace has been hurt somehow, and
is in bed at the master's house. Your son
wishes me to tell you that he knows something
of what happened. He did not mean to
hurt anybody, but three boys might have
died through what was done.'</p>

<p>'Ah, that is just it. Boys never intend
wilfully to hurt each other, I believe, and it
is only rarely that men do so; but they do
it through their weakness and thoughtlessness,
and bring untold misery upon friends, and all
who love them. Your father's spoiled life,
and my brother-in-law's almost wasted one,
should teach all you lads a lesson. Ask God
to make you strong to resist the first temptation&mdash;strong
in the strength of the Lord Jesus
Christ, for this alone can help you in the
hour of trial. And remember that this time
of trial must come to you sooner or later; and
the sooner it comes in life the better, if only you
go to the Strong for strength to sustain you.'</p>

<p>Then the doctor rang the bell, and told
the servant to send Leonard to him. Fred
rose to go, but the doctor told him to sit
down again.</p>

<p>'We'll get this business over while you are
here,' he said. And when Leonard appeared,
he said, 'My friend, Mr. Fred Howard, says<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
you have something to tell me. Yes, he is
my friend, and I trust that you will make
him yours also, if he will accept the friendship
of a boy like you,' said the doctor, answering
the look of perplexity on Leonard's face. 'This
lad's father has saved your uncle's life more
than once, it seems, while you have nearly
killed his brother. Is that true?'</p>

<p>Leonard hung his head, and the tears
slowly gathered in his eyes. 'Did Mr. Warren
tell you that, father?' he said with a gasp.</p>

<p>'I have not seen Warren yet,' said Dr.
Morrison. 'What is it you have to tell me?
Do not be afraid, I want to hear all the truth
from you. Now what is it you have to tell
me, Len?' said the doctor, in a more tender
tone. 'I hear you have got into some scrape
at school, and somebody has got hurt.'</p>

<p>'Yes, father; the scholarship boy, and I
was afraid he might die.'</p>

<p>'Well, what was your share of the mischief?
Did you really wish your schoolfellow
to die?'</p>

<p>'Father, we didn't mean to hurt him really.
We only wanted to drive him away from the
school.' And then, bit by bit, Mr. Morrison
heard the whole story of what had been going
on at Torrington's for the last few months.</p>

<p>Fred was as much astonished as Mr.
Morrison. 'My brother never said a word
about it at home,' he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>'Your brother has the brave gallant spirit
of a gentleman,' said the doctor. 'But what
am I to say of my son and his cowardly
companions? Go to your room, sir!' he said,
addressing Leonard, for he was very angry.</p>

<p>'But, Mr. Morrison, that he should wish
to come and tell you of it before it is known
at the school who has done it, should not
be forgotten,' said Fred, pleadingly.</p>

<p>'Certainly, certainly, it is something, as
you say,' answered Mr. Morrison; but in
truth he felt overwhelmed just now.</p>

<p>As Fred was leaving, a servant from Dr.
Mason's arrived with a note, asking that Mr.
Morrison would bring his son, and be at the
school by nine o'clock.</p>

<p>'Mason has found out all about it, I
expect,' he said, as he read the note. He
gave orders for his carriage to be ready by
half-past eight the following day, for he had a
great deal to do before he started for London
in the evening.</p>

<p>He went to see Leonard in his own room
before he went to bed, and then told him
something of his uncle's life, and why it was
that he wished to befriend Horace Howard.</p>

<p>His father's talk made a deep impression
on the boy's mind. 'Mamma told me something
of this once but she did not say the
"somebody" was my uncle.'</p>

<p>'My boy, she loved this brother as Florrie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
loves you, and how could she tell you all the
miserable tale?'</p>

<p>'Oh, papa, I am so sorry! What can I do
to make you believe that I do mean to try and
do right always for the future? I wish I could
do something for that poor Horace. His
hands are awfully bad, and he won't be able to
use them for ever so long. There's nobody to
take care of him at home either. Don't you
think he might come here, papa?'</p>

<p>Dr. Morrison looked at Leonard, and
breathed a sigh of relief. 'My boy, could I
trust you to be good to him if I fetched him
here to-morrow?'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes, papa; indeed I will try to make
it up to him, if you will let him come. I am
so sorry. I did not know it was going to be
so bad, until I heard Mr. Skeats say he
wondered they were not dead. That was why
I wanted to see Howard's brother. I knew he
was the worst, and I wanted them to know
that I did not mean really to hurt him.'</p>

<p>'I can quite believe and sincerely hope that
this will be a lesson you will never forget
through your whole life. But if I forgive you
it is more than you can expect Dr. Mason to
do. I almost wonder he has not put it into the
hands of the police, and had you all arrested.
The punishment will be severe, I have no
doubt; it ought to be, to make an impression
upon the school; and remember, whatever it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
may be, I shall expect you to bear it patiently
and bravely. I forgive you, but I shall not
seek to lessen the punishment your schoolmaster
may inflict. Now go to sleep as soon
as you can, and I will take you to school in the
carriage with me in the morning.'</p>

<p>Dr. Morrison was compelled to pay a visit
to a patient on his way to the school the next
day, so that when they arrived they found all
the school assembled in the hall. Prayers
were just over, and when Leonard entered
with his father, he was directed to take his
place beside Taylor and Curtis, who were
standing in front of the platform, where Dr.
Mason and the other masters were sitting.
His father was asked to take a seat there
beside two other gentlemen, whom he afterwards
heard were Mr. Curtis and Mr. Taylor,
who had come to hear what their sons were
charged with.</p>

<p>'It might have been manslaughter,' said
Dr. Mason severely, when one of the gentlemen
asked this question rather angrily.</p>

<p>'Last night, before we separated, I asked
if anyone wanted to make a statement about
this matter,' said the master, addressing the
school. 'No one answered then; now it is
too late, and I can tell you myself all that
happened. When the chemistry class left the
laboratory yesterday morning, Mr. Skeats left
three boys to finish what they were doing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
believing that they were the only lads there.
Just after he had gone they heard the stink-chamber
door opened, and Taylor put something
down on Howard's bench, which is close
to that door. They took no notice of this at
first, until the peculiar odour arrested their
attention. Then one of them went round to
see what it was, but coming in closer contact
with the fumes was overcome by them, and
fell down unconscious. Soon a second fell at
his bench, and the third fell just as Howard
opened the laboratory door and called to
them. None were able to answer; but he
pulled two out on to the landing, and then
went back for the third, but fell unconscious
himself, close to his own bench, and near the
lad he was trying to save. Fortunately, his
cry for help was heard, and both lives were
saved, I am thankful to say, although Howard
has been burned a great deal with the acid
of the poison.'</p>

<p>There was a dead silence throughout the
school while the master was speaking. After
a pause he said, 'I do not suppose that either
Taylor, Curtis, or Morrison knew what their
act would be likely to cause. I am sure they
were ignorant of the danger they caused to
three or four of their schoolfellows. But I do
know that for some time past these boys have
been persecuting one of their companions; and
this sort of thing shall never be allowed at this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
school. Therefore, to save this school from
future disgrace and trouble, I am compelled to
expel from the school those who have been
the ringleaders in this persecution. Taylor!
Curtis! your names will be removed from the
school roll, and never again will you be
admitted as scholars of Torrington's school.
Morrison has been greatly to blame in the part
he has taken in this business; but taking into
consideration that he made a full confession to
his father last night of all he had done, added
to the fact that he is a younger and weaker
boy than the others, I shall suspend him from
attending this school for six months; and if
at the end of that time he can bring a
certificate of good conduct from any other
school, he may possibly be reinstated at
Torrington's. The honour of the school
demands that these punishments should be
strictly adhered to.' The master sat down,
and before a boy could leave his place Dr.
Morrison sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>'Dr. Mason, I am an old Torrington boy,'
he said; 'and I thank you with all my heart
for defending the honour of the dear old school.
My son is one of the culprits, and I thank you
in his name for giving him another chance to
retrieve his character. I shall send him for
the six months to one of the board schools in
the town, where I hope and trust he may earn
the right to come among you once more, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
bring no further disgrace upon Torrington's
school.'</p>

<p>The other two gentlemen did not say a
word. They were exceedingly angry with the
culprits, but could not complain that the master
had been unduly severe with them. Before
they left, Dr. Mason said that he must charge
them with the cost of a new suit of clothes for
Horace. 'Those he was wearing yesterday
are burned into holes, so that the poor lad has
nothing to wear when he is able to get up,'
said Dr. Mason.</p>

<p>'I will see to that,' said Dr. Morrison.</p>

<p>'I understand you are going to charge yourself
with the care of the lad until he is well,'
said the master. 'I like justice all round, and
it is only fair these gentlemen should buy the
boy a new suit. Will you leave me to order
it?' he said, addressing the two.</p>

<p>'Yes, yes, of course, and we will pay the
bill,' both answered in a breath.</p>

<p>'Now, Morrison, you can go and tell the
lad that he will soon have some new clothes,
for I understand that is the chief trouble
with him this morning&mdash;that he has spoiled his
best jacket, and burned holes in his trousers.
Mrs. Mason will give you something to take
him home in, and I think it will do both lads
good to know more of each other. The wisest
thing you could do is what you have decided
upon for Leonard, and I hope I shall see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
him back at Torrington's at the end of six
months.'</p>

<p>Mr. Morrison found Fred was with his
brother, but he readily agreed to his being
taken home by the doctor. Horace himself
did not know what to make of it. Fred had
just told him what he had heard from Dr.
Morrison about his father, and now the doctor
assured him that Leonard was very anxious
to make up to him for all the unkindness he
had been guilty of in the past.</p>

<p>'For our father's sake you ought to give
him this chance,' said Fred, for he knew he
could not give his brother the care he needed.</p>

<p>'Thank you, doctor; I will go with you,'
said Horace.</p>

<p>Just as he was being wrapped up Mr.
Warren came in to see his patient, and was
glad to learn that he was going home with
Dr. Morrison.</p>

<p>'You will let Warren come and see me,
won't you?' said Horace.</p>

<p>'Yes, yes, send him by all means; and
I shall be glad if you can look in upon him
yourself to-morrow, for I am obliged to go
to London this evening, so that he must be
left to the tender mercies of Len and the
servants for a day or two.'</p>

<p>Horace was carried to the carriage where
Leonard was seated, shedding a few quiet
tears over the folly that had gained for him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
this suspension for the honour of the school.
Still, he was thankful that he was allowed a
chance of return, and resolved to do all he
could&mdash;even in a board school&mdash;to earn the
right to go back at the end of six months.
He was glad enough to have Horace seated
beside him, and the first words he said were,</p>

<p>'I hope you will forgive me for being
such a fool. We must be friends, you know,
and I hope to come back to Torrington's
with you by-and by.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes, we will be good friends if you
like,' said Horace, with the tears shining in
his eyes. 'Only I don't know what my
mother will say when she comes home.'</p>

<p>'Oh, that will be all right,' answered
Leonard. 'Your mother has gone to London
with my mother. I dare say we shall know
all about it presently. But father is too busy
now, for he is going to London again this
evening, and so I shall have to take care of
you until he comes back. We'll ask Warren
to come and see us as well, because I know
you like Warren.'</p>

<p>This last proposal cost Leonard the most,
for he wanted Horace to like him now. But
it was a proof to Mr. Morrison that his son
had learned to conquer himself; and he had
more hope for him now than he had since
he first heard of this school scandal.</p>

<p>The doctor had taken care to say as little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
as possible to the two boys about the fortune
Mr. Howard had made while he was away,
and it had made so little impression upon
Horace, that when Mr. Morrison came back
from London the next day, and told him that
his mother wanted him to go to the sea-side
as soon as he was able to go, Horace looked
at him in mute wonder.</p>

<p>Could his mother afford to send him to
the sea-side? he wondered, and he resolved
to ask Fred what he thought about it when
he came.</p>

<p>His brother came to sit with him for an
hour every evening, and as soon as they were
left to themselves that night Horace said,
'Have you heard that mother wants us to go
to the sea-side&mdash;Leonard, and you and I?
What does it mean, Fred? Has mother got
money enough now to spend it like that?'</p>

<p>'I suppose she has,' said Fred, with something
like a sigh; 'but I am not sure that it is
going to make us any happier, Horry,' he added.</p>

<p>'Well, I suppose that will depend upon
what we do with it, won't it?' said Horace
simply.</p>

<p>'Well, then I don't know that I shall let
them spend any of it on me,' said Fred, in
an angry tone.</p>

<p>'Then you won't let mother be happy,
though she may have more money, and not
have to work for it now.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>'Now, Horace, you know it is on mother's
account that I feel as I do. It was unkind
and cruel of father to go away and leave
her as he did for years and years, though
he was making a fortune for us. I tell you
that money has been bought too dearly, and
for mother's sake I don't feel as though I
could touch a penny of it.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Fred! think how unhappy she will
be if you say that to her.'</p>

<p>'I have said it,' replied Fred bitterly. 'I
wrote and told her that I hoped she would
leave me to be a carpenter, and live on in
the little cottage where she had worked so
hard.'</p>

<p>'Oh, how could you&mdash;what did she say?'
cried Horace, with the tears shining in his
eyes.</p>

<p>Fred covered his face for a moment. 'She
begged me to forgive my father for her sake, as
though it was not for her sake I feel as I do.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes, I know,' said Horace. 'But
you will have to do as she says, or else we
shall all be so unhappy. Oh, Fred, for
mother's sake, for my sake, forgive father!
for why should I lose my brother because
my father has come home? I cannot help
myself. I must let him help me, and if he
did stay and work for this money just to
prove that he was sorry for what he had
done so long ago, I think we ought to forgive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
him, as mother has. He is ill, too, through
the hardships he had to endure.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Horry, if only he hadn't gone away
like that! To have to forgive your father,
instead of looking up to him as Len Morrison
does, is so bitter; and it might all have been
so different if only he had kept on doing his
duty and asking God to help him when things
were a bit harder than usual.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Fred, ask God to help you now, to
help you forgive him for mother's sake, and
for Jesus Christ's sake!' cried Horace, in a
passion of tears.</p>

<p>'I have, dear, I have! and I think I shall
be able to do it soon; but I think God wanted
me to see that making a fortune can't make up
for not doing the right thing at the right time;
no, not even to the people you may make the
fortune for. I shall have to let my father know
this before I can fully forgive him.'</p>

<p>It was a bitter lesson for the returned
prodigals to learn, for Leonard Morrison took
the same view concerning his uncle, having
memories of days when his mother was too ill
and too sad to be glad with them; and he heard
now from his father that this was generally
caused by some memory of the dearly loved
brother who had fled from them under a
cloud of disgrace.</p>

<p>At length, however, Fred wrote and
assured his mother that for her sake, and for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
his brother's, he would do as they wished, and
join them at the sea-side, when Horace went
for a holiday before returning to school. His
hands were better, thanks to the kind attention
he received from everyone at Dr. Morrison's.
Indeed, he was such good friends now with
Leonard, that he begged to be allowed to
go to the sea-side with him, in order to make
the acquaintance of his mother and his father
as well as of his own uncle, who was still
staying with them to help the invalid.</p>

<p>Fred wrote this letter, and Mrs. Howard
was greatly relieved to receive it. To her it
had been easy enough to receive and pardon
her husband for his long neglect, and she failed
to understand why her elder son, who had
always been so good to her, should assume
such a hard, unforgiving demeanour towards
his father.</p>

<p>But when they met some weeks later she
learned to understand the lad better; and
when she told her husband he said, 'It is
better. He is young, and has all his life before
him, and he is right in thinking that no fortune
can make up for wasted opportunities and
neglected duties.'</p>
